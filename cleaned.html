    Mr. <span style="color:red">Thompson<sup>1</sup></span> reports symptoms suggestive of major depressive disorder (MDD). He describes experiencing persistent low mood, <span style="color:red">anhedonia<sup>2</sup></span>, and feelings of hopelessness for the past <span style="color:red">six months<sup>3</sup></span>. He is a <span style="color:red">construction worker<sup>4</sup></span> and a <span style="color:red">Union member<sup>5</sup></span>.
Mr. <span style="color:red">Thompson<sup>6</sup></span>'s difficulties began soon after the <span style="color:red">death of his wife<sup>7</sup></span> in <span style="color:red">March 2024<sup>8</sup></span>. Since then, he has struggled with sleep disturbances, often waking up early in the morning and being unable to return to sleep. His appetite has diminished, resulting in a <span style="color:red">weight loss of 20 pounds<sup>9</sup></span> over the last <span style="color:red">four months<sup>10</sup></span>. Mr. <span style="color:red">Thompson<sup>11</sup></span> also reports decreased energy levels and difficulty concentrating at work.
During the interview, Mr. <span style="color:red">Thompson<sup>12</sup></span> provided his <span style="color:red">email<sup>13</sup></span> (<span style="color:red">john.t@example.com<sup>14</sup></span>) for further communication and his phone number (<span style="color:red">123-4567<sup>15</sup></span>) in case of emergencies. He lives alone at his <span style="color:red">residence on 456 Elm Street, Springfield, IL<sup>16</sup></span>.
His medical history is significant for <span style="color:red">hypertension<sup>17</sup></span>, managed with <span style="color:red">lisinopril 10 mg daily<sup>18</sup></span>, and a remote history of <span style="color:red">alcohol abuse<sup>19</sup></span>, though he has been sober for <span style="color:red">ten years<sup>20</sup></span>. He denies any use of tobacco or illicit substances. His family history is notable for <span style="color:red">depression<sup>21</sup></span> in his mother and <span style="color:red">bipolar disorder<sup>22</sup></span> in a maternal uncle.
On mental status examination, Mr. <span style="color:red">Thompson<sup>23</sup></span> appeared his stated age, was dressed appropriately for the weather, and was cooperative with the interview process. His speech was of normal rate and volume but had a low tone. His mood was described as "down," and his affect was constricted. Thought processes were logical and goal-directed. There were no overt delusions, hallucinations, or suicidal ideations. Insight and judgment were fair.
The treatment plan for Mr. <span style="color:red">Thompson<sup>24</sup></span> includes initiating <span style="color:red">sertraline 50 mg daily<sup>25</sup></span>, with a plan to reassess in <span style="color:red">four weeks<sup>26</sup></span> for efficacy and tolerability. He was also referred to a <span style="color:red">local mental health clinic<sup>27</sup></span> for psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Furthermore, given the significant impact of his symptoms on his daily functioning, a note will be provided for a <span style="color:red">two-week medical leave from work<sup>28</sup></span>.
In summary, Mr. <span style="color:red">Thompson<sup>29</sup></span> is a <span style="color:red">48-year-old<sup>30</sup></span> male presenting with symptoms consistent with MDD. The onset of his depressive symptoms correlates with significant life stressors, including the loss of his spouse. The treatment regimen includes pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and social support measures to address his comprehensive healthcare needs.
