MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]11/05/2022[O] 2:30 PM CLINICAL INDICATION: [B-AGE]55-year-old[O] male presents with new-onset seizures and headache. COMPARISON: None conducted previously. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla scanner, images taken both with and without the application of gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There is evidence of a small 3 mm focus of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the left frontal lobe, suggesting possible gliosis or low-grade glioma. No evidence of significant mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci appear within normal limits for patient age. There is no abnormal enhancement post-contrast suggesting no active inflammation or high-grade neoplastic processes. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Non-specific small focus of hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, potentially representing gliosis or low-grade glioma. Further evaluation with follow-up MRI in 6 months is recommended to assess the stability or progression.
