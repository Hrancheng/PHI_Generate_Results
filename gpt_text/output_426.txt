TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla unit. Axial, coronal, and sagittal sequences obtained with and without the administration of 15 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: There is a 2 cm enhancing lesion on the left frontal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema. No evidence of midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal. Diffusion-weighted imaging shows no signs of acute ischemia. Venous sinuses are patent with normal flow voids. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Left frontal lobe lesion, recommend further evaluation with biopsy to rule out neoplasia. No evidence of acute ischemic changes or hemorrhage.
