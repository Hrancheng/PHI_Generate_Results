NECK ULTRASOUND EVALUATION [B-DATE]10/5/2020[O] CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of thyroid nodules. COMPARISON: No prior ultrasound available. TECHNIQUE: Imaging performed using a high-resolution ultrasound machine with a variable frequency transducer. FINDINGS: The thyroid gland is normal in size with homogeneous echotexture. There are three nodules in the right lobe of the thyroid:
Nodule #1: Location: upper pole of the right lobe. Size: 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. Characteristics: hypoechoic, solid, with regular margins. No calcifications or extrathyroidal extension. Nodule #2: Location: mid portion of the right lobe. Size: 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.6 cm. Characteristics: isoechoic, solid, with spongiform appearance. Nodule #3: Location: lower pole of the right lobe. Size: 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Characteristics: hypoechoic, partially cystic, with well-defined margins.
The left thyroid lobe and isthmus are unremarkable with no nodules or cysts. There is no evidence of pathologically enlarged cervical lymph nodes. The parathyroid glands are not visualized. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple thyroid nodules as described. The largest nodule at the upper pole of the right thyroid lobe warrants follow-up due to its solid and hypoechoic nature. Recommend repeat ultrasound evaluation in [B-DATE]6 months[O] to monitor for changes in size or characteristics. Follow-up clinical examination is also suggested. 2. No abnormal cervical lymphadenopathy or parathyroid pathology evident.
