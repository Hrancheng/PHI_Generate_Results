Example 21:

EXAM: MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]11/27/2019[O]. 
INDICATION: Lower back pain with radiation to the left leg. Rule out nerve impingement. 
COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]2/12/2018[O].
TECHNIQUE: MRI Lumbar spine was performed without contrast on a 3 Tesla magnet. 

FINDINGS: 
- Lumbar spine shows normal alignment without evidence of significant spondylolisthesis.
- Intervertebral disc levels from L1-L2 through L5-S1 demonstrate mild diffuse disc bulge. 
- No significant central canal or neural foraminal narrowing except for a moderate left paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 impinging on the left L5 nerve root.
- The conus medullaris terminates at L1 level and appears normal.
- Mild facet joint hypertrophy is noted at L4-L5 and L5-S1.
- No evidence of acute fracture or marrow infiltrative process.

IMPRESSION: 
1. Moderate left paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 level impinging on the left L5 nerve root correlating with clinical symptoms.
2. No significant central canal stenosis.
3. Mild facet arthropathy at lower lumbar levels.
