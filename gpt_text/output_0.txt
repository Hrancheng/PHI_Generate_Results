Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]09/15/2024[O]. INDICATION: Evaluation of headaches and suspected demyelinating disease. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed using a 3 Tesla scanner, sequences include T1, T2, FLAIR, and DWI. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]01/12/2024[O]. FINDINGS: There is no significant interval change in the size or number of the multiple white matter hyperintensities seen bilaterally in the cerebral hemispheres, which are characteristic of demyelinating plaques. There is no evidence of new demyelination or active lesions with contrast enhancement. Ventricles and brain sulci are within normal limits for the patient's age. Impression: 1. Stable appearance of known demyelinating plaques without new or active disease. 2. No evidence of emergent intracranial pathology.
