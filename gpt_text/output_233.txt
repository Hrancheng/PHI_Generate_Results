Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM DETAILED ASSESSMENT, dated [B-DATE]07/15/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: [B-AGE]72-year-old[O] female with history of dyspnea and suspected heart failure. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]01/22/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: Comprehensive 2D echocardiography with Doppler and color flow mapping performed. FINDINGS: The left ventricle shows normal size with mildly reduced systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is 45%. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation are noted. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. No pericardial effusion or intracardiac thrombus is seen. Aortic valve is trileaflet with mild aortic stenosis. The estimated peak gradient across the aortic valve is 25 mmHg. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure is elevated, estimated at 35 mmHg. IMPRESSION: 1. Mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function. 2. Moderate left atrial enlargement. 3. Mild aortic stenosis with no significant stenotic burden. 4. Elevated pulmonary artery pressures suggestive of pulmonary hypertension.
