Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI, dated [B-DATE]07/15/2021[O]. INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram [B-DATE]06/28/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging performed employing stress and rest protocols to assess myocardial viability and function, using a 3 Tesla MRI system. FINDINGS: The left ventricular chamber size is normal, with preserved wall thickness and systolic function. Hypokinetic segments are noted in the inferior wall, suggesting myocardial damage. Late gadolinium enhancement was observed in these regions, indicating the presence of fibrosis or scarring, likely due to a previous myocardial infarction. No evidence of pericardial effusion or significant valvular abnormalities were observed. Normal right ventricular size and function. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Features consistent with an old inferior myocardial infarction. No active ischemic changes observed. 2. Normal ventricular function with no acute cardiomyopathic changes.
