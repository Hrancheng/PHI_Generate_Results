Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI dated [B-DATE]09/15/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for myocardial fibrosis. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram [B-DATE]08/01/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI conducted using late gadolinium enhancement technique to assess myocardial viability. FINDINGS: The left ventricle demonstrates normal size and systolic function with an ejection fraction estimated at 65%. There is a focal area of late gadolinium enhancement involving the mid myocardium of the basal inferolateral wall, consistent with myocardial fibrosis. No evidence of myocardial edema or pericardial effusion. Right ventricular size and function are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Presence of myocardial fibrosis in the basal inferolateral wall. 2. Normal right and left ventricular size and function.
