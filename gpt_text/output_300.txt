Example 21:
CRANIAL CT SCAN WITH CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]8/5/2024[O], CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of headaches and dizziness. HISTORY: Patient reports increased frequency of migraines. COMPARISON: MRI from [B-DATE]5/22/2024[O]. TECHNIQUE: A non-contrast followed by a contrast-enhanced helical CT scan was performed using 75 mL of non-ionic contrast material. The scan covered from the base of the skull through the vertex without complications. FINDINGS: The ventricles and sulci appear normal. There is no evidence of intracranial mass effect or midline shift. No acute hemorrhage or extra-axial fluid collections are observed. The cerebral parenchyma shows no signs of ischemic changes or infarcts. The pituitary gland and sellar region appear intact. Following contrast administration, there was no abnormal enhancement observed in the brain. The major intracranial vessels demonstrate normal caliber and contrast enhancement without evidence of stenosis or occlusion. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Persistent symptoms of headaches and dizziness should continue to be clinically monitored. 3. Further evaluation with MR angiography may be considered if symptoms persist.
