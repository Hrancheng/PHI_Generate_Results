Example 21:  
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/25/2022[O] 10:30 AM  
INDICATION: Evaluation of progressive headaches and memory loss in a [B-AGE]68-year-old[O] male patient.  
COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]8/15/2020[O].   
TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed using a 3 Tesla scanner with and without the administration of 15 mL of Gadovist intravenous contrast.  
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci remain stable when compared to prior studies. There is mild generalized atrophy appropriate for age. White matter hyperintensities consistent with small vessel ischemic changes are observed, slightly more prominent than the previous study but still within normal limits for age. No new areas of abnormal enhancement are identified. 
IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Mild progression of chronic small vessel ischemic changes. 3. Stable mild cerebral atrophy. Continued clinic-radiological follow-up is recommended.
