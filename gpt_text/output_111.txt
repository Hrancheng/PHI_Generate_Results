Example 21:
MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/22/2021[O] at 10:00 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]52-year-old[O] male with history of chronic low back pain, worsening over the past six months. COMPARISON: MRI of the lumbar spine dated [B-DATE]4/15/2020[O], [B-DATE]2/12/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI is performed using a 3 Tesla scanner at [B-ORGANIZATION]Regional Orthopedic Center[O]. Images obtained before and after the administration of 15 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast without complication. FINDINGS: Examination reviews five lumbar vertebral bodies with normal alignment and bone marrow signal intensity. Discs at L1-L2 through L4-L5 show mild to moderate disc desiccation and height loss, consistent with degenerative changes. There is a 3 mm broad-based disc protrusion at L4-L5 mildly indenting the thecal sac but not impinging on nerve roots. Facet joints across the scanned levels demonstrate mild arthritic changes without significant joint effusion. The conus medullaris appears normal in position and signal, and the cauda equina nerve roots are freely floating in the cerebrospinal fluid without abnormal clumping or thickening. IMPRESSION: 1. No significant change since the last MRI, degenerative disc disease most prominent at L4-L5 with mild central disc protrusion. Recommendations: Continue current medical management, reassess in one year unless symptoms increase.
