Example 21:
MRI SPINE CERVICAL WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]10/14/2022[O]. INDICATION: [B-AGE]52-year-old[O] male with chronic neck pain and radiculopathy. COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]7/20/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla magnet, utilizing sequences in the sagittal and axial planes with and without gadolinium enhancement. FINDINGS: There are degenerative changes noted in the cervical spine, particularly at C5-C6 where there is mild to moderate disc protrusion impinging on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac but not causing significant neural foraminal narrowing. The adjacent vertebrae display moderate degenerative endplate changes. No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. The spinal cord exhibits normal signal intensity without evidence of myelopathy. Visualized soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild to moderate degenerative disc disease at C5-C6 with disc protrusion. 2. No significant neural foraminal narrowing or myelopathy. Follow-up or further evaluation with EMG studies may be beneficial in assessing the extent of radiculopathy.
