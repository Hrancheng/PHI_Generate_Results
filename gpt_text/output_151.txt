Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]9/14/2021[O]. HISTORY: Increasing headaches and episodes of confusion. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain from [B-DATE]5/10/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI examination was conducted on a 3 Tesla magnet. Images obtained with and without the use of gadolinium-based contrast material. FINDINGS: There is evidence of a small, non-enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe measuring approximately 1.4 x 1.1 cm. The lesion demonstrates increased signal on T2-weighted images, with no significant mass effect or midline shift. The surrounding white matter appears unremarkable. No evidence of hydrocephalus or acute hemorrhage. The major intracranial arterial and venous structures demonstrate normal flow voids. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable small non-enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe, no interval change in size compared to [B-DATE]5/10/2021[O]. 2. No features suggestive of high-grade glioma or metastatic disease. Follow-up MRI in three months or if clinically indicated.
