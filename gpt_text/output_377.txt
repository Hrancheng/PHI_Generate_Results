Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]09/15/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram [B-DATE]08/10/2021[O]. 

TECHNIQUE: Diagnostic imaging performed using [B-ORGANIZATION]Memorial Cardiac Imaging Center[O]. Standard cardiac sequences utilized, both pre- and post-administration of 15 mL of Gadolinium contrast.

FINDINGS: The study shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%. There is hypokinesis of the anterior wall, suggestive of myocardial damage. The remaining myocardial segments display normal contractile function. No signs of myocardial scarring or non-viable myocardium were noted. The cardiac chambers appear normal in size. There are no signs of pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: 
1. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior wall hypokinesis, suggestive of recent myocardial infarction.
2. No myocardial scarring or pericardial effusion.
3. Decreased ejection fraction as compared to previous studies indicating progression of cardiac condition.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Clinical correlation with cardiac enzymes and clinical presentation is recommended.
- Follow-up with a cardiology specialist at [B-ORGANIZATION]Memorial Cardiac Imaging Center[O] for further management and possible medical therapy adjustments.
