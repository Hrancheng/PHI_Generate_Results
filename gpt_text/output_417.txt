Example 21:
MRI CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]07/05/2022[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Neck pain and radiculopathy following [B-DATE]March 2021[O] motor vehicle accident, assess for disk herniation. COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]09/20/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, and axial T2 sequences were obtained of the cervical spine. FINDINGS: The visualized portions of the cervical spine demonstrate normal alignment with no evidence of dislocation or fracture. Disk dehydration is noted at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated disk bulge mildly indenting the thecal sac. No significant neural foraminal narrowing. No compression on the cervical spinal cord is observed. The vertebral bodies maintain normal bone marrow signal and cortices. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute disk herniation or significant spinal canal compromise. 2. Chronic changes observed at C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels likely secondary to degenerative disk disease.
