FINDINGS: There is moderate disc degeneration at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with disc bulges mildly indenting the thecal sac anteriorly. No significant neural foraminal narrowing. No focal disc herniation or significant compressive pathology noted. The conus medullaris terminates at L1 level and appears normal. The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No progression of disc degeneration compared to prior imaging. 2. Mild disc bulges at L4-L5 and L5-S1 without significant compressive effects.
