Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated [B-DATE]07/21/2021[O]  
CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of chest pain and shortness of breath.  
COMPARISON: Echocardiogram from [B-DATE]03/15/2020[O].  
TECHNIQUE: Transthoracic echocardiography performed using standard views with Doppler and color flow imaging.  

FINDINGS:  
Left Ventricular Function: The left ventricle is normal in size with preserved systolic function, ejection fraction estimated at 55-60%. No regional wall motion abnormalities are observed.  
Right Ventricular Function: The right ventricle is normal in size and function.  
Valves:  
- Mitral Valve: Mild mitral regurgitation.  
- Aortic Valve: Trileaflet aortic valve without significant stenosis or regurgitation.  
- Tricuspid and Pulmonic Valves: Normal in appearance and function without significant regurgitation.  
Atria: Normal size of both the left and right atria.  
Pericardium: No pericardial effusion noted.  
Doppler: Normal diastolic function with no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.  

IMPRESSION:  
1. Normal left ventricular size and systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55-60%.  
2. Mild mitral regurgitation.  
3. No evidence of pericardial effusion or pulmonary hypertension.  
Recommend follow up with cardiology in [B-DATE]6 months[O] for routine monitoring.
