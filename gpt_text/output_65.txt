Example 21:  
MRI SPINE CERVICAL WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/21/2022[O] 14:30 PM. INDICATION: [B-AGE]52-year-old[O] male with history of chronic neck pain, evaluating for disc herniation. COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]10/15/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the cervical spine was performed utilizing a 3 Tesla magnet without the administration of intravenous contrast. Axial, sagittal, and coronal T1, T2 weighted images were obtained through the cervical spine. FINDINGS: The cervical vertebral bodies maintain normal alignment. Disc desiccation is noted at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with mild disc height loss at these levels. At C6-C7, there is a mild broad-based posterior disc protrusion which mildly indents the ventral aspect of the thecal sac but does not result in significant spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. No significant cord compression or intrinsic cord abnormality is identified. The remaining intervertebral discs show no significant protrusion, and the neural foramina are widely patent. The visualized portions of the spinal cord exhibit normal signal intensity. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild degenerative disc disease at C4-C5 and C5-C6. 2. Mild broad-based posterior disc protrusion at C6-C7 without significant spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
