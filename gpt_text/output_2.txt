**Example 21:**
Procedure: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST  
Date: [B-DATE]05/07/2021[O]  
Indication: Suspected multiple sclerosis.  
Comparison: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]03/15/2020[O].  

**TECHNIQUE:**  
MRI performed with standard multiple sclerosis protocol using 1.5 Tesla machine. Both T1-weighted sequences with and without gadolinium contrast and T2-weighted sequences were acquired. FLAIR sequences extensively reviewed.  

**FINDINGS:**  
Examination of the brain reveals several new foci of T2 hyperintensity and FLAIR within the periventricular white matter bilaterally compared to the previous examination dated [B-DATE]03/15/2020[O]. The largest new lesion measures approximately 6 mm located in the left frontal lobe. No evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. Post-contrast images show no abnormal enhancement to suggest active demyelination.  

**BRAINSTEM AND CEREBELLUM:**  
No pathologic signal changes or abnormal enhancement.  

**INTRACRANIAL VASCULATURE:**  
Major arterial and venous structures appear patent with normal flow voids on spin-echo sequences.  

**VENTRICLES AND SULCI:**  
Stable size of the ventricular system. No evidence of midline shift. Sulci are age-appropriate.  

**SKULL BASE AND CRANIAL NERVES:**  
Unremarkable.  

**ORBITS:**  
The visualized portions of the orbits are within normal limits, with extraocular muscles of normal size and configuration. Optic nerves are symmetric without enlargement or enhancement.  

**PARANASAL SINUSES AND MASTOID AIR CELLS:**  
Mild mucosal thickening noted in the maxillary sinuses. Mastoid air cells are well-aerated.  

**IMPRESSION:**  
 1. New scattered white matter lesions in periventricular locations, probably representative of disease progression in the setting of suspected multiple sclerosis.  
 2. No evidence of active demyelination on post-contrast images.  
 3. No acute intracranial pathology.  

**FOLLOW-UP:**  
Recommend clinical correlation with neurology for possible therapy adjustment. Consider follow-up MRI in 6 months or sooner if clinically indicated.
