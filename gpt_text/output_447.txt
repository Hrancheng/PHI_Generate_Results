Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]3/15/2022[O] at 10:30 AM. INDICATION: [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] male with history of recurrent glioblastoma. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated [B-DATE]1/12/2022[O], [B-DATE]11/10/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI brain was performed at [B-ORGANIZATION]Park Lane Neurology Center[O] using a high-field 3 Tesla scanner under glioblastoma surveillance protocol. Phased array head coil was used. Images were acquired before and after the administration of 15 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: The known right parietal lobe tumor exhibits increased size and enhancement compared to prior examinations, now measuring 3.5 x 4.2 x 3.8 cm. This represents an interval progression. Associated vasogenic edema has slightly increased, exerting mild mass effect on the adjacent lateral ventricle. No new hemorrhage or acute infarct demonstrated. Other brain structures including the brainstem and cerebellum appear unremarkable. No evidence of leptomeningeal spread. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Interval progression of known right parietal glioblastoma. Increased surrounding edema noted. Continued follow-up and treatment adaptation recommended.
