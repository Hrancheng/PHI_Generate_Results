Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]4/15/2021[O] 11:30 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]57-year-old[O] female with complaints of progressive headache and dizziness. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]1/10/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla unit following the [B-ORGANIZATION]Cleveland Clinic[O] standardized brain protocol with and without gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are of normal size and configuration. There are patchy areas of T2 hypersensitivity within the periventricular white matter, likely representing chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No significant midline shift. The cerebellum, brainstem, and basal ganglia appear normal. Post-contrast images show no abnormal enhancement to suggest active demyelination or neoplastic process. Cranial nerves are intact, and the visualized orbits are unremarkable. The pituitary gland and infundibulum are normal in appearance with homogeneous enhancement. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology. 2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes, no progression compared to prior examination on [B-DATE]1/10/2021[O]. Follow-up as clinically indicated.
