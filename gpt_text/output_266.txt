MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/21/2022[O] 2:15 PM INDICATION: [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] female with new onset seizures and headaches. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]1/15/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla machine using the [B-ORGANIZATION]Central City Neurological Institute[O] comprehensive brain protocol. FINDINGS: There is evidence of a 1.2 cm enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe, which appears slightly larger compared to the prior study. No significant midline shift. There is mild perilesional edema but no significant mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal. The major intracranial vessels show no signs of stenosis or aneurysm. The visualized orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air cells are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. New increase in size of right frontal lobe lesion since [B-DATE]1/15/2020[O], suggestive of a growing neoplasm. Further assessment with biopsy and additional imaging studies recommended. 2. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or ischemic changes.
