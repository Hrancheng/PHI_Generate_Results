Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]10/10/2022[O]. INDICATION: [B-AGE]72-year-old[O] female with history of progressive memory loss and suspected dementia. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]03/15/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla machine using the [B-ORGANIZATION]Green Valley Health System[O] Alzheimer's protocol. Images were obtained before and after the administration of 15 mL of Gadovist intravenous contrast without complication.

FINDINGS: There is an increased cortical atrophy when compared to the previous study, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes. No significant white matter changes are noted. There is no evidence of acute ischemic changes or space-occupying lesions. Mild small vessel ischemic changes are noted. The hippocampal volumes are reduced, consistent with the patientâ€™s clinical presentation and age. Cerebrospinal fluid spaces are prominent due to cerebral atrophy. No midline shift or herniation is observed.

IMPRESSION: 
1. Advanced cortical atrophy, consistent with clinical suspicion of Alzheimer's disease.
2. Stable mild small vessel ischemic disease.
3. No acute intracranial pathology.
