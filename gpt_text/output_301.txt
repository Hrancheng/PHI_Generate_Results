Example 21:
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) OF THE BRAIN [B-DATE]10/15/2021[O] AT 3:30 PM CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of chronic headaches and suspected demyelinating disease. Comparison: MRI dated [B-DATE]07/25/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla machine. Sequences included T1, T2, FLAIR, and DWI. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage. Multiple white matter hyperintensities are noted on FLAIR and T2 sequences, predominantly located in the periventricular and subcortical areas, suggestive of chronic microangiopathic changes or a demyelinating process. The ventricles and sulci are within normal limits for the patient's age. No midline shift. The major intracranial vessels show normal flow voids. The pituitary gland, sella turcica, and cavernous sinuses appear normal. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute brain pathology. 2. Multiple white matter changes likely represent chronic ischemic changes or demyelinating disease. Further clinical correlation and follow-up MRIs are recommended to monitor progression.
