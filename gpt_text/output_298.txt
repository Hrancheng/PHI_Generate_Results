CT ABDOMEN PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/13/2022[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for abdominal pain and weight loss. COMPARISON: CT from [B-DATE]1/15/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multi-detector CT was performed with pre-contrast, arterial, and venous phase images obtained following the administration of 100 mL of non-ionic contrast. FINDINGS: The liver has multiple, low attenuation lesions suggesting metastatic disease. The largest lesion is approx. 3.5 cm in the right hepatic lobe. Pancreas is atrophic with calcifications noted, suggestive of chronic pancreatitis or prior inflammatory process. The spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. No lymphadenopathy is detected. Extensive small bowel and colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis. The urinary bladder is non-distended and appears normal. There is no free air or fluid in the abdominal cavity. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple liver lesions consistent with metastatic disease. 2. Chronic changes in the pancreas. 3. No evidence of acute diverticulitis.
