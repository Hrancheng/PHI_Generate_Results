Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/05/2022[O] INDICATION: [B-AGE]65-year-old[O] female with history of chronic headaches and recent episode of syncope. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]1/22/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: T1, T2, FLAIR sequence and diffusion-weighted imaging were performed. Pre and post-contrast images obtained. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci are appropriate for the patient's age. There is a stable 2 mm pituitary microadenoma, unchanged from previous study. No significant midline shift. The post-contrast images show no new enhancement or abnormal mass effect. The major intracranial blood vessels appear patent without evidence of stenosis. Minor white matter hyperintensities consistent with microangiopathic changes. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Stable pituitary microadenoma. 3. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes without acute ischemia.
