EXAM: HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]11/15/2020[O] 10:20 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] male presents with sudden onset severe headache and dizziness. COMPARISON: Prior CT scan [B-DATE]01/22/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: Axial and coronal non-contrast enhanced CT scans of the head were performed. The scan was done using standard head protocol without any complications. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. No midline shift is observed. There is no evidence of mass effect or significant cerebral edema. The basal cisterns are open. Scattered foci of white matter hypodensities likely represent chronic microvascular ischemic changes. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology identified. 2. Stable scattered foci of chronic microvascular ischemic changes when compared to previous imaging dated [B-DATE]01/22/2019[O]. No further follow-up imaging is recommended at this time unless new symptoms arise.
