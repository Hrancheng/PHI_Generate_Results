Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]09/15/2021[O] CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for possible demyelinating disease following recent episodes of visual disturbances and numbness. Comparison: MRI from [B-DATE]07/05/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed with and without the administration of 15 mL Gadovist contrast agent. FINDINGS: There is no new demyelination; a few nonspecific small white matter hyperintensities are noted but remain stable compared to the previous study. No evidence of acute ischemic changes. The ventricles and sulci are within normal limits. The pituitary gland, sella, and cavernous sinuses appear normal. No intracranial mass, midline shift, or evidence of increased intracranial pressure. IMPRESSION: Stable MRI brain without new demyelinating lesions. Continued follow-up recommended.
