Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM COMPREHENSIVE [B-DATE]09/17/2021[O] CLINIC INDICATION: Shortness of breath and recent episode of syncope. TECHNIQUE: 2D, Doppler, and color flow imaging performed. IMAGES REVIEWED: Prior echocardiogram [B-DATE]12/15/2020[O]. FINDINGS: The left ventricular chamber size and systolic function are within normal limits, with an estimated ejection fraction of 55%. No regional wall motion abnormalities are observed. The right ventricle appears normal in size and function. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is of normal size. Valve Examination: The aortic valve is trileaflet with no significant stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, with mild mitral regurgitation noted. The tricuspid valve is normal with trivial regurgitation. The pulmonary valve is not well visualized, but appears functionally normal with no significant abnormalities noted. Pulmonary pressures are within normal limits, estimated at 25 mmHg. Doppler evaluation shows normal valvular and intracardiac gradients. No pericardial effusion. No intracardial masses or clots. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal left ventricular size and function. 2. Mild dilatation of left atrium. 3. Mild mitral regurgitation with structurally normal mitral valve. 4. Overall normal echocardiogram with no urgent concerns noted.
