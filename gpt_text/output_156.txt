ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated [B-DATE]02/14/2021[O]. 
HISTORY: Suspected myocardial infarction. 
COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]01/20/2021[O]. 
TECHNIQUE: Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using the [B-ORGANIZATION]Heart and Health Institute[O] cardiac protocol. A total of 16 views were obtained for comprehensive evaluation. 
FINDINGS: 
- Left ventricular systolic function is preserved with an ejection fraction estimated at 55%. 
- No regional wall motion abnormalities were noted. 
- The right ventricle is normal in size and function. 
- Valves appear structurally normal without significant stenosis or regurgitation. 
- Atrial sizes are within normal limits. 
- No pericardial effusion or intracardiac thrombus is visualized. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Normal left ventricular systolic function. 
2. No acute cardiomyopathy or significant valvular disease. 
3. Comparison with previous echocardiogram shows stable cardiac structure and function.
