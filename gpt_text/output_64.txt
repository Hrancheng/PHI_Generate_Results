Example 21:
ULTRASOUND ABDOMEN COMPLETE [B-DATE]06/21/2021[O] 15:00 PM INDICATION: Evaluation for possible gallstones. COMPARISON: Ultrasound dated [B-DATE]05/15/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: Full abdominal ultrasound scan performed using a phased array transducer. The examination included visualization of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and large vessels. FINDINGS: The liver is homogeneously echogenic without focal lesions. The gallbladder is well-distended and demonstrates multiple echogenic foci without acoustic shadowing, suggestive of cholesterolosis rather than calculi. There is no biliary dilatation. The pancreas is homogeneously echogenic and of normal morphology without any lesions or duct dilatation. The spleen and both kidneys are normal in appearance without focal lesions or hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple echogenic foci within the gallbladder likely represent cholesterolosis; absence of acoustic shadows makes gallstones less likely. 2. No evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. 3. Normal pancreas, spleen, and renal morphology.
