Example 21:
CHEST X-RAY, PA AND LATERAL, dated [B-DATE]10/21/2022[O] 3:45 PM. INDICATION: Suspected pneumonia. COMPARISON: X-ray from [B-DATE]8/15/2022[O]. FINDINGS: The lungs are hyperinflated but without evidence of focal airspace disease. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The visualized osseous structures of the thorax appear intact. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease identified, stable hyperinflation likely reflective of underlying COPD. No changes from previous study on [B-DATE]8/15/2022[O]. Recommendations: Follow-up with primary care provider, consider pulmonary function testing if not recently performed.
