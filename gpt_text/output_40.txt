Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]4/18/2020[O] at 10:30 AM. INDICATION: [B-AGE]63-year-old[O] female with a history of recurrent migraines and new onset visual disturbances. COMPARISON: Prior MRI [B-DATE]3/15/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla magnet using a [B-ORGANIZATION]General Hospital Neurology Department[O] comprehensive brain protocol. Images obtained prior to and following administration of 15 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made with previous studies, showing stable appearance of previously noted small non-enhancing periventricular white matter hyperintensities consistent with microangiopathic changes. No new areas of abnormal enhancement or restricted diffusion are identified. The ventricles and sulci appear normal in size and configuration for the patientâ€™s age. Visualized cranial nerves are intact without abnormal enhancement.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
2. Stable white matter changes as described.
3. No new findings compared to the previous MRI dated [B-DATE]3/15/2020[O]. 
4. Recommend clinical correlation with ophthalmological evaluation given the patient's new visual symptoms.
