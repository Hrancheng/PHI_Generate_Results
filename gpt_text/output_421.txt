Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI CERVICAL SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]10/14/2020[O] CLINICAL INDICATION: Chronic neck pain with recent exacerbation, evaluate for disc herniation or nerve impingement. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]04/12/2019[O]. FINDINGS: Cervical spine is imaged from the C1 to T1 levels. The cervical vertebrae demonstrate normal alignment with no evidence of acute fracture or subluxation. Disc hydration is preserved across cervical levels. There is a small disc protrusion at the C5-C6 level without significant spinal canal or neural foramen narrowing. No significant change from the prior MRI. The spinal cord maintains normal caliber and signal intensity with no evidence of myelopathy. Vertebral bodies maintain normal marrow signal. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute cervical spine pathology. 2. Small disc protrusion at C5-C6, stable compared to previous MRI, without significant impingement or myelopathy. 3. Recommend continued conservative management and follow-up as clinically indicated.
