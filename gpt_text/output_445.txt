Example 21:
MRI CERVICAL SPINE W AND WO CONTRAST, [B-DATE]9/15/2021[O] 10:30 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]52-year-old[O] female with history of progressive neck pain and radiculopathy. COMPARISON: MRI of the cervical spine from [B-DATE]1/22/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: 1. MRI performed using a high-field 3.0 Tesla machine with and without the administration of 15 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: There is maintenance of normal cervical lordosis. Disc desiccation and mild disc height loss are noted at C4-C5 and C5-C6 levels, with a broad-based disc protrusion at C5-C6 mildly indenting the ventral aspect of the thecal sac but not resulting in significant spinal canal stenosis. No significant foraminal narrowing is observed at any level. There is no evidence of cord compression or significant neural foraminal narrowing. The cervical spinal cord exhibits normal signal intensity without evidence of intramedullary lesion. The visualized portions of the posterior fossa structures appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No significant change from prior MRI dated [B-DATE]1/22/2020[O]. 2. Mild cervical spondylosis without acute disc herniation or significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis.
