Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]11/15/2021[O] at 10:30 AM. INDICATION: Evaluation for possible brain metastasis in a [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] patient with known lung carcinoma. COMPARISON: MRI Brain dated [B-DATE]08/22/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner with brain metastasis protocol at [B-ORGANIZATION]City Medical Center[O]. Images obtained pre and post administration of 15 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: There is a new 1.2 cm enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe consistent with metastasis. No evidence of significant mass effect or midline shift. The previously noted smaller lesions in the right parietal and left occipital lobes show stable appearance. No new areas of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. The ventricular system is stable without hydrocephalus. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New left frontal lobe lesion likely representing metastasis in the context of known lung carcinoma. 2. Stable appearance of previously documented metastatic lesions. Additional follow-up with contrast-enhanced MRI in 3 months is recommended.
