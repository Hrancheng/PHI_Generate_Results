Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]10/13/2022[O] TIME: 14:15 PM INDICATION: [B-AGE]52-year-old[O] female with new-onset seizures. COMPARISON: Prior CT head dated [B-DATE]9/29/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI performed on a 3 Tesla system. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration for patient's age. There is a small area of gliosis in the right temporal lobe, likely related to prior trauma. No new focal abnormality is seen. Post-contrast images show no abnormal enhancement to suggest active inflammatory disease or neoplastic process. The major intracranial vessels appear patent on MR angiography. No significant paranasal sinus disease. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology identified. 2. Small area of right temporal lobe gliosis, likely sequelae of prior trauma.
