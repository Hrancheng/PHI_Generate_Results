Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI [B-DATE]9/21/2021[O] 2:30 PM INDICATION: Evaluation for myocarditis following acute viral infection. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram [B-DATE]8/5/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla scanner at the [B-ORGANIZATION]General Hospital Imaging Center[O]. FINDINGS: Myocardial edema in the basal segments of the left ventricle, consistent with inflammatory changes. Left ventricular function is preserved, with an ejection fraction estimated at 55%. No evidence of fibrosis or necrosis on late gadolinium enhancement. Right ventricular size and function are normal. No evidence of pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: 1. MRI findings suggestive of myocarditis, correlating with clinical history of recent viral infection. 2. Normal right ventricular size and function.
