Example 21:
ECHO CARDIOGRAM [B-DATE]10/04/2021[O] TIME: 1415 Hrs. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of left ventricular function due to history of myocardial infarction. TECHNIQUE: Transthoracic echo was performed in the echocardiography lab. Images were obtained in multiple views. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]09/15/2020[O]. FINDINGS: The left ventricle is normal in size with mild global hypokinesia. Ejection fraction estimated at 40-45%. No significant wall motion abnormalities noted. The right ventricle is normal in size and function with no evidence of hypertrophy or dilation. No pericardial effusion is seen. Valves are grossly normal without significant regurgitation or stenosis. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild global left ventricular hypokinesia with moderately reduced ejection fraction, likely ischemic in nature. 2. Stable cardiac function compared to prior study.
