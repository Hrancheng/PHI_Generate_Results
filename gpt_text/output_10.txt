Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI, dated [B-DATE]09/14/2021[O] 10:30 AM. INDICATION: Evaluation of cardiac function post-myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]08/05/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed using a phased-array cardiac coil on a 1.5 Tesla scanner according to the [B-ORGANIZATION]Heart Institute Protocol[O]. Examination included cine sequences in multiple planes for functional assessment and delayed enhancement sequences to assess for myocardial scar. FINDINGS: Left ventricular function is moderately reduced with an ejection fraction estimated at 40%. There is thinning and hypokinesis of the anterior wall, which is consistent with the known territory of the prior infarct. Mild mitral regurgitation was noted. No significant right ventricular dilation or dysfunction. No pericardial effusion. Delayed enhancement sequences show a subendocardial enhancement pattern in the anterior wall extending from the apex to the mid-ventricular level, suggestive of a myocardial scar. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Reduced left ventricular function with evidence of anterior myocardial scar consistent with previous myocardial infarction. 2. Mild mitral regurgitation. No pericardial effusion or significant right ventricular dysfunction.
