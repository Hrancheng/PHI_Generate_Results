Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]9/15/2023[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of new-onset seizures. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the brain was performed using high-field 3.0 Tesla MRI system. Intravenous contrast was administered without incident.

FINDINGS:
- There are no areas of restricted diffusion to suggest acute ischemia. 
- The cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, and cerebellum appear normal without evidence of mass effect or midline shift. 
- No intra or extra-axial fluid collections noted.
- The ventricular system is within normal limits for age. 
- Post-contrast images show no abnormal enhancement within the brain parenchyma or meninges.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute ischemic injury.
2. Normal MRI of the brain with and without contrast. No findings suggest an underlying cause for seizures, and further clinical correlation is recommended.
