Example 21: 
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]10/14/2021[O]. INDICATION: [B-AGE]63-year-old[O] female with history of progressive memory loss, suspected dementia. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]8/3/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the brain was performed without and with intravenous contrast on a 3T magnet. Findings consistent with bilateral hippocampal atrophy. No new areas of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. No enhancing masses. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with cerebral atrophy. The basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem structures are normal in morphology. No evidence of midline shift or mass effect. Cortical ribbon is intact with no focal cortical thinning. There are a few small foci of signal abnormality in the white matter, most likely representing small vessel ischemic changes. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Features suggestive of atrophic changes, likely related to underlying neurodegenerative disease. Recommendations: Continued neurologic follow-up and consider neuropsychological testing for further evaluation of memory impairment.
