Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]10/27/2022[O] at 10:00 AM. CLINICAL INDICATION: [B-AGE]67-year-old[O] female with new onset seizures and cognitive decline. COMPARISON: MRI brain [B-DATE]03/15/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multisequence imaging of the brain performed with and without gadolinium on a 1.5 Tesla scanner following established protocol at [B-ORGANIZATION]Greenwood Neurological Center[O]. FINDINGS: The MRI shows mild diffuse cerebral atrophy appropriate for age. There are no significant white matter changes suggestive of acute demyelinating disease. No evidence of intracranial mass, acute infarction, or hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, consistent with atrophy. The basal ganglia, thalami, cerebellum, and brainstem appear normal. Uniform enhancement with the contrast is noted, with no areas of abnormal enhancement to suggest a neoplastic process. The orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air cells are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of intracranial mass, stroke, or hemorrhage. 2. Findings are consistent with mild cerebral atrophy, consistent with patientâ€™s age and clinical presentation.
