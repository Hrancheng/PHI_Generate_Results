Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]9/15/2021[O] at 10:30 AM. INDICATION: [B-AGE]72-year-old[O] male with complaints of progressive memory loss and confusion. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]6/20/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla machine using the standard dementia protocol. Pre and post-intravenous administration of 15 mL of Gadovist. FINDINGS: There are multiple foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter and subcortical regions consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic change. No evidence of acute infarction. Hippocampal volumes are reduced bilaterally which are consistent with the patient's clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. There is no significant mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are appropriately prominent for the patientâ€™s age. No extra-axial fluid collections are seen. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial findings. 2. Advanced microvascular ischemic changes and reduced hippocampal volumes consistent with clinical Alzheimer's disease. 3. No new significant interval changes when compared to the prior study.
