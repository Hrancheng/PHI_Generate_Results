Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated [B-DATE]07/15/2021[O] CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of cardiac function due to recent episodes of atypical chest pain. HISTORY: Patient reports increasing shortness of breath and intermittent pressure-like chest pain over the last 3 months. FAMILY HISTORY: Father had bypass surgery at [B-AGE]55 years[O] old. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]12/10/2019[O].

TECHNIQUE: Standard transthoracic echocardiogram performed with Color Doppler, Tissue Doppler, and spectral Doppler evaluations.

FINDINGS:
- The left ventricle is normal in size with preserved wall thickness.
- Left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated at 60% with no regional wall motion abnormalities.
- Right ventricle is normal in size and function.
- Valves are generally unremarkable with trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
- No pericardial effusion or intracardiac masses are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal left and right ventricular size and function.
2. No evidence of significant valvular disease.
3. The symptoms could be non-cardiac, but recommend correlation with clinical symptoms and possible further testing as clinically indicated.
4. Follow-up as needed based on clinical symptoms.

This echocardiogram provides an overview of current cardiac structure and function, aligning with patient-reported symptoms for informed clinical follow-up and management.
