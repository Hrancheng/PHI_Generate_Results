Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]09/15/2021[O] at 10:30 AM INDICATION: Evaluation for myocardial viability post-infarction. PREVIOUS STUDIES: None. TECHNIQUE: Initial non-contrast sequences followed by intravenous administration of 0.2 mmol/kg Gadovist. Phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequences acquired in multiple planes. FINDINGS: The left ventricle demonstrates normal size with mild hypokinesis of the inferior wall. Late gadolinium enhancement suggests focal myocardial scarring in the basal inferior segment. No evidence of right ventricular involvement. Normal left and right ventricular systolic function. Pericardium is normal without signs of constriction or effusion. IMPRESSION: 1. Evidence of focal scarring in the basal inferior segment of the left ventricle indicating prior myocardial injury. 2. No current cardiac compromise or dysfunction. 3. Suggested clinical follow-up and potentially pharmacologic treatment adjustment based on cardiac MRI findings.
