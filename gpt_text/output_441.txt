Example 21:
PROSTATE MRI WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/29/2021[O] 3:30 PM INDICATION: Evaluation for prostate cancer due to elevated PSA levels. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]10/29/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multi-parametric MRI was performed using a 3 Tesla unit involving T1, T2, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences. FINDINGS: The prostate gland is homogeneously enhanced with no focal lesions or suspicious areas of restricted diffusion. The central gland and peripheral zones show no evidence of tumor. Prostate size is stable compared to the prior study, measuring 4 cm in transverse dimension. Seminal vesicles and neurovascular bundles are intact and without pathology. The visualized bones and soft tissues of the pelvis reveal no abnormalities or lymphadenopathy. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No MRI evidence of prostate cancer. 2. Stable prostate anatomy compared to prior examination.
