Previous comparison: Ultrasound from [B-DATE]12/5/2019[O] TECHNIQUE: High-resolution imaging performed. FINDINGS: The thyroid gland is heterogeneously enlarged. The right lobe measures 4.1 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm and the left lobe 4.3 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm. Multiple hypoechoic nodules are seen in both lobes. The largest nodule in the right lobe measures 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm, showing mild internal vascularization without significant growth compared to the prior study. The left lobe contains a 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm nodule with similar characteristics. No suspicious microcalcifications or abnormal lymph nodes are observed. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable appearance of multinodular goiter. 2. No evidence of malignant transformation. Recommending annual follow-up with ultrasound for ongoing surveillance.
