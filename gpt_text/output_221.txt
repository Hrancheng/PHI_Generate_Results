Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI [B-DATE]3/15/2022[O], 10:30 AM INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected myocarditis. COMPARISON: None TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed using [B-ORGANIZATION]Bellevue Medical Center[O]'s standardized cardiac protocol. Pre- and post-contrast sequences were obtained without complication. FINDINGS: The left ventricle demonstrated normal size and systolic function with an ejection fraction estimated at 55%. There is mild diffuse hypokinesia of the basal inferolateral wall. Late gadolinium enhancement indicated mid-myocardial late enhancement in the basal inferolateral segment, suggestive of myocardial fibrosis or edema consistent with myocarditis. The right ventricle was normal in size and function. The atria appeared normal. No pericardial effusion or significant valve disease observed. IMPRESSION: 1. Features consistent with myocarditis predominantly affecting the basal inferolateral segment of the left ventricle. Recommendation for follow-up cardiac MR in [B-DATE]six months[O] to reassess myocardial changes.
