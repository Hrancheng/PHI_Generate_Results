Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [B-DATE]10/05/2022[O] 11:30 AM CLINICAL INDICATION: Dyspnea on exertion and suspected congestive heart failure. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]07/15/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: Standard transthoracic echocardiogram with spectral and color Doppler imaging was performed. FINDINGS: The left ventricular ejection fraction measured at 45%, slightly reduced from previous 50%. Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy is noted. Diastolic dysfunction is present with impaired relaxation. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. No valvular vegetations are identified. There is mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension. The aorta is unremarkable. The atria are normal in size with no evidence of thrombus. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction since last evaluation with mild concentric hypertrophy. 2. Diastolic dysfunction consistent with congestive heart failure symptoms. 3. Mild pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation. Patient is recommended to continue with current heart failure medication and follow-up as scheduled in 3 months or sooner if symptoms worsen.
