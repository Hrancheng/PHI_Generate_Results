Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT [B-DATE]09/15/2022[O] 10:30 AM INDICATION: Abnormal heart sounds detected during a routine check-up. HISTORY: [B-AGE]52-year-old[O] male with a history of hypertension. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]08/10/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Comprehensive 2D echocardiogram with Doppler and color flow imaging was performed. FINDINGS: The left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is normal, with an ejection fraction estimated at 55%. No regional wall motion abnormalities were noted. Right ventricular size and function are normal. The mitral valve is structurally normal with trace mitral regurgitation. The aortic valve has mild leaflet thickening, but normal opening mechanics; trace aortic regurgitation is noted. The tricuspid valve is normal with trace regurgitation. Pulmonary pressures are within normal limits. The pericardium is unremarkable with no evidence of pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Normal left and right ventricular size and function. 2. Mild aortic valve leaflet thickening with trace regurgitation. 3. Trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitations, not hemodynamically significant.
