Example 21:
BRAIN MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]10/15/2021[O]. INDICATION: Suspected multiple sclerosis. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla magnet. T1, T2, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted sequences were obtained in multiple planes. Contrast was administered intravenously without complications. FINDINGS: Multiple white matter hyperintensities consistent with demyelination are noted, particularly within the periventricular and subcortical areas. No evidence of enhancement post-contrast, suggesting no active lesions. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. No evidence of mass effect or midline shift. The major intracranial blood vessels are patent. IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of demyelinating disease without active lesions. Continued follow-up with neurology is recommended for management of multiple sclerosis.
