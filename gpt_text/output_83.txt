Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]09/22/2022[O] at 10:00 AM. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for suspected myocarditis following viral infection. COMPARISON: Echo dated [B-DATE]08/15/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: Dynamic and static sequences performed using a 3.0 Tesla machine, following the administration of 15 mL of Gadobutrol. FINDINGS: There is mild global hypokinesis of the left ventricle with a preserved ejection fraction of approximately 45%. No evidence of myocardial fibrosis or infiltration noted on the late gadolinium enhancement sequences. Mild pericardial effusion without signs of constriction. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild global hypokinesis of the left ventricle likely related to recent viral myocarditis. 2. No myocardial fibrosis or late enhancement suggestive of infiltrative processes. 3. Mild pericardial effusion, likely reactive.
