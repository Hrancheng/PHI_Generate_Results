Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated [B-DATE]11/15/2021[O]. HISTORY: Suspected congestive heart failure. COMPARE: Echocardiogram [B-DATE]09/10/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: Standard transthoracic echocardiography with Doppler flow studies was performed. FINDINGS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated at 55%, consistent with normal systolic function. Left atrial enlargement is noted. Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Aortic valve appears structurally normal with no significant stenosis. Normal pulmonary artery pressures. Normal RV size and function. No pericardial effusion. CONCLUSION: 1. Normal left ventricular systolic function. 2. Left atrial enlargement and mild valvular regurgitation noted. Recommend follow-up echocardiography in one year or earlier if symptoms increase.
