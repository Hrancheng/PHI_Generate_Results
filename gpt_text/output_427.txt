Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH CONTRAST DATED [B-DATE]07/15/2022[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluate cardiac function post-myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Cardiac MRI [B-DATE]01/20/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: MultiPlanar, MultiSequence MRI of the heart, performed using [B-ORGANIZATION]Bethesda Heart Institute[O] standard cardiac protocol. Gadolinium contrast was administered without complication. FINDINGS: The left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness are within normal limits. Normal systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction of 55%. There is a thin linear area of late gadolinium enhancement involving the mid myocardial segment of the anteroseptal wall, consistent with non-transmural myocardial scarring. No evidence of myocardial edema. Right ventricle is normal in size and function. Valves appear structurally intact with no significant stenosis or regurgitation. Pericardium is normal without evidence of thickening or pericardial effusion. Great vessels including the aorta and pulmonary arteries are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable non-transmural scarring in the anteroseptal wall. 2. Normal left and right ventricular systolic function. No acute cardiomyopathy or pericardial disease.
