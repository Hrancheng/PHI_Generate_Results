COMPARISON: EKG from [B-DATE]02/14/2021[O].  
FINDINGS:  
1. Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of approximately 110 bpm.  
2. Normal axis and intervals.  
3. No significant ST-T wave changes observed.  
4. Ventricular pre-excitation pattern is not evident.  
5. The comparison with the previous EKG shows a new onset of atrial fibrillation  
6. Chest X-ray indicated to exclude any potential pulmonary causes of palpitations.  

IMPRESSION:  
1. New atrial fibrillation without rapid ventricular response.  
2. No evidence of ischemic changes or other acute findings on the current EKG compared to [B-DATE]February 2021[O].  
3. Recommend echocardiogram to assess atrial size and rule out structural heart disease.
