Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]09/15/2022[O] 10:40 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]54-year-old[O] male with history of progressive cognitive decline. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated [B-DATE]05/11/2022[O] and [B-DATE]12/18/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: 1. MRI performed using [B-ORGANIZATION]Harborview Medical Center[O] standard brain protocol. Images obtained before and after administration of 15 mL of gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There is a persistently enlarged ventricular system when compared to prior studies. No evidence of new mass, midline shift, or acute ischemic changes. Mild diffuse cerebral volume loss consistent with patient's age and clinical history. Multiple small white matter hyperintensities likely represent chronic microvascular ischemic changes. No new areas of restricted diffusion or abnormal enhancement post-contrast. Visualized portions of the orbits and paranasal sinuses are within normal limits. Nasal airways are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Stable appearance of known ventriculomegaly. 3. Chronic microvascular changes without new progression.
