### Example 21:
**MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST**, dated [B-DATE]10/21/2021[O] 14:45 PM  
**INDICATION:** [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] female with a history of lower back pain and suspected lumbar spondylosis.  
**COMPARISON:** MRI lumbar spine dated [B-DATE]5/16/2019[O].  
**TECHNIQUE:** A multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the lumbar spine was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast.  
**FINDINGS:**  
- The lumbar vertebral bodies maintain normal height and marrow signal.  
- Mild broad-based disc bulge at L3-L4 and L4-L5 without significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.  
- Facet joints at L4-L5 and L5-S1 show mild degenerative changes.  
- No acute disc herniation or nerve root impingement is evident.  
- The conus medullaris terminates at L1 without abnormal signal.  
- Incidental note is made of a 9 mm hemangioma in the body of L3.  

**IMPRESSION:**  
1. No significant change when compared to [B-DATE]5/16/2019[O]. Mild degenerative disc disease as described above.  
2. Incidental hemangioma at L3, unchanged.  

All findings were discussed with [B-ID]#45235[O] over the phone immediately after study completion at 15:30 PM.
