Example 21:
NECK ULTRASOUND dated [B-DATE]11/15/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of thyroid nodules and lymphadenopathy. COMPARISON: Previous ultrasound [B-DATE]10/18/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: High-resolution ultrasound with color Doppler was utilized to assess the thyroid gland and surrounding cervical lymph nodes.

FINDINGS: 
The right thyroid lobe measures 4.2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm, and the left thyroid lobe measures 4.0 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm. There is a new hypoechoic nodule in the right lobe measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm, showing irregular margins and microcalcifications, slightly more prominent compared to the previous exam. No increased vascularity is noted within the nodule on Doppler imaging. The isthmus is normal in size. Several small reactive lymph nodes are identified bilaterally in the neck, the largest measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.6 cm in the right jugular chain, unchanged from prior.

IMPRESSION:
1. New hypoechoic nodule within the right thyroid lobe with suspicious features warranting further evaluation with fine needle aspiration.
2. Stable small reactive cervical lymphadenopathy.
3. No significant change in the size of the thyroid gland as compared to the previous study.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Fine needle aspiration of the right thyroid nodule under ultrasound guidance to rule out malignancy.
2. Follow-up ultrasound in six months or sooner if clinically indicated.
3. Patient education about symptoms of thyroid dysfunction and instruction to immediately report any changes in voice, swallowing, or neck swelling.

The patient's next scheduled follow-up is [B-DATE]5/15/2022[O] to discuss the results and plan further management as needed.
