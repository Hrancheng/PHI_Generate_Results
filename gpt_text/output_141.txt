Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT [B-DATE]10/14/2022[O]
CLINICAL HISTORY: [B-AGE]72-year-old[O] male with a history of congestive heart failure and recent hospitalization due to worsening shortness of breath.
INDICATION: Evaluation of cardiac ejection fraction and chamber sizes.
TECHNIQUE: Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using a phased-array transducer. Images were captured in multiple views, including parasternal long and short axis, apical four-chamber, and subcostal views.

FINDINGS:
1. Left Ventricular Function: The left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated to be 45-50%, indicating mild systolic dysfunction. The left ventricle is mildly dilated.
2. Valves: The mitral valve exhibits mild regurgitation. The aortic valve is trileaflet with mild stenosis. The tricuspid valve shows trace regurgitation.
3. Atria: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is normal in size.
4. Pericardium: No evidence of pericardial effusion.
5. Additional Findings: There is no intracardiac thrombus or mass seen. The aortic root is normal size.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of approximately 45-50%.
2. Mild dilation of the left atrium and left ventricle.
3. Mild mitral regurgitation and mild aortic stenosis.
4. Trace tricuspid regurgitation.
5. No pericardial effusion.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Continue medical management of heart failure.
- Follow up echocardiogram in one year to reassess cardiac function and valve status.
