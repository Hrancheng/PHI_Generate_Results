MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]09/15/2022[O] INDICATION: [B-AGE]52-year-old[O] male with chronic low back pain, rule out nerve root impingement. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]8/21/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla machine.

FINDINGS: There is a moderate broad-based posterior disc protrusion at L4-L5 causing mild indentation on the thecal sac. No significant nerve root impingement is noted. Mild facet joint hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening are evident at multiple levels. No evidence of spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The vertebral body heights and alignment are maintained. The conus medullaris and cauda equina appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No change in the moderate disc protrusion at L4-L5 when compared to the previous MRI. 2. No acute nerve root impingement. 3. Recommendations for conservative management with physical therapy and follow-up as needed.
