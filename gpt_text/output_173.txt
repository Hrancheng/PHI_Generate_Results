Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI, dated [B-DATE]7/25/2021[O] 11:00 AM INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]6/15/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: A comprehensive cardiac MRI was performed using a 3.0 Tesla machine, with specific sequences to assess cardiac structure, function, and tissue characterization without complications. FINDINGS: The left ventricular chamber size is within normal limits, with preserved systolic function. Ejection fraction calculated to be 63%. No regional wall motion abnormalities are observed. The myocardium shows no evidence of delayed enhancement to suggest myocardial scarring or fibrosis. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. Valves are structurally normal without significant stenosis or regurgitation. Pericardium is normal without evidence of pericardial effusion or thickening. Pulmonary veins return to the left atrium without anomalies. The aorta is unremarkable with normal arch and root dimensions. No significant coronary artery disease is visualized on this non-contrast study. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal cardiac structure and function by MRI criteria. 2. No evidence of myocardial infarction, scarring, or significant coronary artery disease.
