Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, [B-DATE]09/15/2022[O] 08:30 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] female with new onset seizures. COMPARISON: CT head dated [B-DATE]08/01/2022[O] and previous MRI dated [B-DATE]07/15/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner using standard brain sequences with and without administration of 20 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: New 2 cm enhancing mass in the right temporal lobe, suggesting possible primary brain tumor or metastasis. No significant mass effect or midline shift. Previous areas of white matter changes are stable compared to the last MRI. There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in appearance. Other brain structures including the cerebellum and brainstem show no abnormal findings. Basal ganglia and thalami are unremarkable. Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New enhancing mass in the right temporal lobe likely representing primary brain tumor or metastasis. 2. Stable white matter changes. Further evaluation with biopsy and additional imaging modalities recommended for definitive diagnosis.
