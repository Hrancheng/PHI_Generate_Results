Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI SPINE LUMBAR WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]9/15/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Severe lower back pain with radiculopathy. COMPARISON: Previous CT scan dated [B-DATE]8/1/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed with and without the administration of 15 mL Gadavist intravenous contrast. Images obtained in multiple planes and sequences to adequately assess the lumbar spine.

FINDINGS:
- The lumbar spine demonstrates normal vertebral body alignment with no acute fracture or malalignment.
- Disc desiccation noted at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.
- Moderate disc bulge at L4-L5 with superimposed broad-based central disc protrusion exerting pressure on the thecal sac and contributing to mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.
- No significant central canal stenosis observed at other levels.
- The conus medullaris and cauda equina appear normal.
- Post-contrast images show no abnormal enhancement to suggest active inflammation or infection.

IMPRESSION:
1. Lumbar spondylosis most pronounced at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels with associated disc protrusion contributing to mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.
2. No evidence of significant central canal stenosis or nerve root impingement.
3. Stable findings compared to previous imaging.

Follow-up with [B-ORGANIZATION]Spine Care Associates[O] is recommended for potential therapeutic injections to alleviate pain and physical therapy to improve back function. Further evaluation may include electromyography (EMG) if symptoms persist or worsen.
