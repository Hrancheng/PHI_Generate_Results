Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]10/23/2022[O] CLINICAL INDICATION: Severe headaches and dizziness. HISTORY: Increasing frequency of migraine-like symptoms over the past six months. Prior studies: Non-contrast head CT [B-DATE]04/10/2022[O]. COMPARISON: MRI brain [B-DATE]05/15/2020[O] FINDINGS: The brain parenchyma shows no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift. Ventricles and sulci are normal for [B-AGE]52-year-old[O] patient. No evidence of abnormal enhancement post-contrast. The pituitary gland and infundibulum appear normal. Slight prominence of the cerebral aqueduct noted, without signs of hydrocephalus. White matter shows few scattered non-specific foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity, likely related to small vessel ischemic changes. The major intracranial flow voids are maintained. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology identified. 2. Stable appearance compared to prior MRI dated [B-DATE]05/15/2020[O]. Recommend clinical correlation for continuing symptoms and consideration of follow-up imaging if symptoms persist or worsen.
