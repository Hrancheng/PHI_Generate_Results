Example 21:
CERVICAL SPINE MRI dated [B-DATE]10/21/2022[O] at 2:20 PM. CLINICAL INDICATION: Persistent neck pain after motor vehicle accident. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: High-resolution MRI was performed focusing on the cervical spine using a dedicated cervical coil with T1, T2, STIR, and gradient echo sequences. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Reversible mild cervical lordosis likely muscular in origin secondary to spasm. 2. Small central disc protrusion at C6-C7 mildly contacting but not compressing the anterior aspect of the spinal cord. No significant neural foraminal narrowing. 3. Multilevel degenerative disc disease most pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated mild osteophytic changes. 4. No evidence of acute fracture. 5. The visualized paraspinal musculature and spinal cord signal are within normal limits. No paraspinal mass or fluid collection is seen.
