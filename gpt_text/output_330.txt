Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT [B-DATE]09/22/2022[O] at 10:00 AM.
CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected heart failure.
COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]06/15/2022[O].
FINDINGS:
Left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 40%, decreased compared to previous ejection fraction of 52%.
Left ventricular diastolic dimension (LVIDd) is measured at 5.4 cm, suggesting left ventricular dilatation.
Right atrium and ventricle are normal in size and function.
Mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation were noted.
No pericardial effusion.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 30 mmHg, indicating mild pulmonary hypertension.
The aortic root diameter is within normal limits.
Bioprosthetic aortic valve is functionally normally with no evidence of stenosis or regurgitation.
Technical quality of the examination was good.
IMPRESSION:
1. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, consistent with systolic dysfunction, indicating progression of suspected heart failure. Further clinical correlation and potential upward adjustment of heart failure therapy recommended.
2. Mild valvular regurgitations without hemodynamic compromise.
3. Stable pulmonary artery pressures with mild pulmonary hypertension.

No follow-up recommendations included in this report due to lack of significant interval change apart from the noted progression in systolic function.
