MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]10/20/2021[O] 10:45 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]63-year-old[O] female with new onset seizures. COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]8/15/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the brain was performed using a 3 Tesla magnet with and without the administration of 20 mL gadolinium-based contrast. FINDINGS: The study demonstrates no significant interval change compared to the prior MRI. There is no evidence of acute ischemic changes or mass effect. Old lacunar infarcts are seen in the deep white matter. No new areas of abnormal enhancement are seen post-contrast administration. The ventricles and sulci are of normal size for the patientâ€™s age. The basal ganglia and thalami are normal in appearance. The visualized orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Stable appearance of chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No evidence of new or progressive disease.
