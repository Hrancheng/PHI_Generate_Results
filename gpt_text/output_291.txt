Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated [B-DATE]09/17/2022[O]. CLINICAL HISTORY: [B-AGE]72-year-old[O] male with a history of congestive heart failure. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]07/05/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: Transthoracic echocardiogram performed at [B-ORGANIZATION]Heart Care Associates[O] using an Acuson Sequoia ultrasound machine. FINDINGS: The left ventricle is hypertrophied with preserved systolic function, estimated ejection fraction of 55%. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mitral valve exhibits mild to moderate regurgitation. Aortic valve is trileaflet with mild calcification and mild aortic regurgitation. There is mild tricuspid regurgitation with associated mild pulmonary hypertension. The right ventricle and right atrium are normal in size and function. Doppler studies show normal filling patterns with no significant diastolic dysfunction. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Hypertrophic left ventricle with preserved ejection fraction. 2. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. 3. Mild aortic and tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension.
