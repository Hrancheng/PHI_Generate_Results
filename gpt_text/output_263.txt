Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]10/23/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for possible multiple sclerosis. HISTORY: Patient reports chronic headaches and intermittent numbness in extremities. COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]8/15/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI scan was performed using a 3 Tesla machine with standard MS protocol, including FLAIR, T1, T2, and diffusion-weighted sequences. FINDINGS: New periventricular white matter lesions noted, measuring up to 3 mm. No significant mass effect or midline shift. Ventricular system is within normal limits for patient's age. Optic nerves appear symmetric with normal signal intensity. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or old blood products. No significant abnormalities noted in the cerebellum or brainstem. IMPRESSION: New periventricular lesions likely representing demyelinating disease. No evidence of acute ischemia or hemorrhage. Recommend clinical correlation and follow-up with neurology for potential MS management.
