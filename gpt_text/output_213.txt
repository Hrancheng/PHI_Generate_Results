Example 21:
PROCEDURE: BRAIN MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]10/21/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for multiple sclerosis. HISTORY: New onset right-sided weakness. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed using a 3 Tesla machine with multiple sequences including T1, T2, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging before and after the administration of 0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium-based contrast agent. FINDINGS: There are several well-circumscribed hyperintensities on FLAIR and T2 weighted images predominantly involving the periventricular white matter consistent with demyelinating plaques. The largest lesion measures approximately 2 cm in the left frontal white matter. There is mild enhancement of a few lesions post-contrast suggestive of active inflammation. No evidence of mass effect or midline shift. The ventricular size and sulcal pattern are within normal limits. Other intracranial structures including the brainstem, cerebellum, and basal ganglia are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. MRI findings consistent with multiple sclerosis. Active plaques suggest ongoing disease activity. Consideration for initiation or modification of disease-modifying therapy recommended. 2. No evidence of other intracranial pathology.
