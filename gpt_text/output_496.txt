MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]07/25/2020[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected demyelinating disease. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla scanner using [B-ORGANIZATION]Harvard Medical School[O] approved brain protocol including axial, sagittal, and coronal T1, T2, FLAIR, and T1 post-contrast sequences. FINDINGS: There is evidence of multiple hyperintense T2/FLAIR lesions predominantly located within the periventricular white matter bilaterally, consistent with Dawson's fingers. No significant mass effect or midline shift. Enhancing lesions are noted following contrast administration indicating active demyelination. The brainstem and cerebellum show no abnormal signal. Ventricles and sulcal spaces are within normal limits for patient's age. No evidence of acute hemorrhage. Visualized orbits and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple sclerosis with active demyelination as evidenced by enhancing lesions. 2. Recommend correlation with clinical history and laboratory data. Follow-up MRI in six months or sooner if clinically indicated.
