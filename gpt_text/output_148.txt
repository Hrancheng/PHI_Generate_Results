Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]10/3/2021[O] 
INDICATION: Evaluation of potential myocardial scar. 
HISTORY: [B-AGE]54-year-old[O] male with a history of myocardial infarction, currently experiencing atypical chest pains. 
TECHNIQUE: Dynamic and static images were acquired using a 3 Tesla MRI system according to the standardized cardiac protocol. 

FINDINGS: 
1. The left ventricle demonstrates normal systolic function with an ejection fraction estimated at 60%.
2. There is a small area of delayed enhancement at the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle, suggestive of a small, non-transmural myocardial scar. 
No new wall motion abnormalities were detected. Right ventricle and atria are normal in size and function.
3. The pericardium is unremarkable without evidence of thickening or fluid collection.

IMPRESSION: 
1. Small area of myocardial scarring at the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle likely related to previous myocardial infarction.
2. No evidence of active ischemia or adverse remodeling.
___
Continued surveillance and follow-up recommended with echocardiography in one year, or sooner if symptoms recur. Further evaluation with a stress test may be considered.
