Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]10/23/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Headaches and dizziness. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]1/15/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was conducted using a 3 Tesla magnet. Both T1 and T2-weighted images along with FLAIR sequences were obtained prior to and after the administration of gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: 

There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci appear normal in size and configuration. There are a few nonspecific white matter hyperintensities likely related to small vessel ischemic changes. There is no abnormal enhancement to suggest active demyelination or infection. 

The visualized portions of the orbits, skull base, and major intracranial vessels are unremarkable. Optimization of angiographic detail was performed using [B-ORGANIZATION]Johns Hopkins University[O] advanced MR angiography protocol.

IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable nonspecific small vessel white matter changes when compared to the previous MRI. 2. No new significant abnormal findings.
