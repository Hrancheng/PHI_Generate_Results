Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]09/15/2022[O] 10:30 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]67-year-old[O] male with history of chronic heart failure. COMPARISON: Echo dated [B-DATE]05/20/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed using a 3 Tesla machine, standard cardiac protocol with administration of 15 mL of Gadovist contrast. FINDINGS: Review of the function and structure of the heart chambers shows limited left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 35%. Presence of diffuse late gadolinium enhancement in the myocardium suggestive of fibrosis. Right ventricle is normal in size and function. No evidence of myocardial scar or infiltrative process. Pulmonary veins return normally without evidence of anomalous drainage. Pericardium appears free of effusion or thickening. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Confirmed low ejection fraction with evidence of diffuse myocardial fibrosis. 2. Stable cardiac function compared to the previous assessment, no significant progression of disease. 3. No pericardial effusion.
