Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/05/2022[O] INDICATION: Evaluation of known dilated cardiomyopathy. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram [B-DATE]01/15/2022[O] and cardiac MRI [B-DATE]10/05/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed with administration of 15 mL Gadolinium contrast without incident. Dynamics of myocardial enhancement and perfusion were assessed. FINDINGS: There is generalized hypokinesia of the left ventricle, with an ejection fraction estimated at 25%. No significant change compared to the previous year's MRI. The right ventricle is normal. Diffuse late gadolinium enhancement suggests myocardial fibrosis, primarily in the mid myocardial wall of the anterior and lateral walls. There is no evidence of infiltrative or restrictive cardiomyopathy. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No significant interval change in the morphology or function of the heart relative to the previous cardiac MRI. 2. Persistent severe systolic dysfunction suggestive of a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
