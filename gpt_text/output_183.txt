MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]07/29/2022[O], 3:00 PM INDICATION: [B-AGE]54-year-old[O] male presenting with new-onset seizures. COMPARISON: Prior MRI from [B-DATE]01/15/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was conducted using a 1.5 Tesla machine employing the [B-ORGANIZATION]General Hospital's[O] standard brain protocol. Pre and post-contrast images were obtained. FINDINGS: There is evidence of a 2 cm enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe, which was not visible on the previous MRI. No significant midline shift. The ventricles and sulci appear normal. Post-contrast images show mild enhancement of the mass suggesting active lesion. No other significant abnormalities noted in the brain parenchyma. The basal ganglia, thalami, brainstem, and cerebellum appear unremarkable. No evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarction. Cerebral and cerebellar vasculature via TOF MRA is patent without evidence of stenosis or aneurysm. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New 2 cm enhancing lesion in the left temporal lobe suggestive of primary brain neoplasm or metastasis. Further evaluation with biopsy and neuropathological correlation is recommended for definitive diagnosis. 2. No acute hemorrhagic or ischemic changes.
