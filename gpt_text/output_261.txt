COMPARISON: CT scan dated [B-DATE]08/14/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT performed from diaphragm to pubic symphysis using 100 mL of non-ionic contrast material. Images were reconstructed in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. FINDINGS: The liver is normal in size with no focal lesions. The gallbladder shows small cholesterol polyps without signs of cholecystitis. The pancreas is unremarkable with no evidence of mass or ductal dilation. The spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted. The stomach and bowel loops are unremarkable with no signs of obstruction or inflammation. There is no free fluid or air. A 2 mm low-density lesion in the right lobe of the liver likely represents a simple cyst or hemangioma. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable low-density lesion in the right lobe of the liver, likely benign. 2. No significant change since last exam. Follow-up as clinically indicated.
