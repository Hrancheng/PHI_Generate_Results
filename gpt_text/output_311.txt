Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]9/14/2022[O] at 10:30 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]53-year-old[O] female experiencing progressive headaches. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain from [B-DATE]5/19/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI is performed on a 3 Tesla machine, including T1, T2, FLAIR sequences, and diffusion-weighted imaging with and without the administration of 15 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. The ventricular system is normal in size and configuration without evidence of hydrocephalus. There is a new 1.2 cm enhancing lesion on the left frontal lobe, which was not present in the previous MRI from [B-DATE]5/19/2022[O]. This lesion exhibits ring enhancement with central necrosis suggestive of a high-grade glioma. No other suspicious intra-axial or extra-axial lesions are identified. The major intracranial vascular structures demonstrate normal flow voids. The brain parenchyma elsewhere shows normal signal intensity. Perfusion and spectroscopy sequences show elevated choline and decreased NAA peaks within the lesion, consistent with malignant features. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New left frontal lobe lesion likely representing a high-grade glioma. Recommend biopsy to confirm pathology. 2. No other significant changes compared to the previous MRI. Suggested follow-up with [B-ORGANIZATION]Radiology Oncology[O] for further management and treatment planning.
