Example 21:
LUMBAR SPINE MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]5/15/2021[O] 10:30 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] male with chronic lower back pain, rule out nerve impingement. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]1/27/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner using the [B-ORGANIZATION]Regional Health Services[O] spine protocol without and with administration of 15 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: There is moderate degenerative disc disease at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with associated disc bulging and facet hypertrophy. Mild spinal canal stenosis at L4-L5. No evidence of nerve root impingement. Post contrast images show no abnormal enhancement suggesting no active inflammatory processes. The conus medullaris terminates at L1, and the cauda equina appears normal. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild to moderate degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with no evidence of nerve root impingement or active inflammation. 2. Stable comparison to prior study.
