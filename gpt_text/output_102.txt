Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]6/22/2020[O] at 14:30 hours. INDICATION: Evaluation for multiple sclerosis. COMPARISON: MRI brain dated [B-DATE]12/15/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI is performed on a 3 Tesla machine using [B-ORGANIZATION]Mercy Health Hospital[O] standard protocol for brain imaging with and without gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There are several new high T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities in the periventricular white matter bilaterally, consistent with demyelinating plaques. Previous lesions as noted on the comparison MRI are unchanged. New lesions are noted in the right frontal and left occipital lobes. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or midline shift. The major intracranial flow voids are intact. IMPRESSION: 1. New and unchanged periventricular demyelinating lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis. 2. Absence of acute intracranial process.
