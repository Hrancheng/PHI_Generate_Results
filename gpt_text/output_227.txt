Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]11/14/2022[O] HISTORY: Sudden onset headache and visual disturbances. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]02/15/2020[O] and [B-DATE]06/01/2018[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla [B-ORGANIZATION]Central City Medical Imaging[O] standard brain protocol with additional sequences as per attending radiologist instructions. IMAGES: MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography) and MRV (Magnetic Resonance Venography) performed to evaluate vascular structures with and without the administration of 15 mL Gadavist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. The cerebral hemispheres appear symmetric with no infarction or significant white matter disease. The ventricular system is normal in size and configuration without shift. There is no abnormal enhancement or vascular malformation observed on the MRA or MRV sequences. The pituitary gland and the skull base structures are unremarkable. Overall, the brain parenchyma demonstrates normal signal intensity without evidence of demyelination or degenerative changes. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology identified. 2. Stable appearance compared to previous studies.
