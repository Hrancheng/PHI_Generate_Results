ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT 
[B-DATE]10/22/2021[O] 
INDICATION: Evaluation of cardiac function. 
COMPARISON: Echocardiogram [B-DATE]01/15/2020[O]. 
TECHNIQUE: Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed including M-mode, 2D, color flow, and Doppler analysis. 

FINDINGS: 
The left ventricle is normal in size with preserved systolic function. Ejection fraction estimated at 55%. No regional wall motion abnormalities. 
The right ventricle is normal in size and function. 
Valves: Mild mitral regurgitation. Tricuspid, aortic, and pulmonic valves appear normal with no significant stenosis or regurgitation. 
Atrial sizes are normal. 
No pericardial effusion. 

DIAGNOSIS: 
No change in cardiac function compared to last evaluation. Mild mitral regurgitation without hemodynamic significance. 

IMPRESSION: 
1. Normal left and right ventricular size and systolic function.
2. No significant valvular abnormalities.
3. Mild mitral regurgitation.
