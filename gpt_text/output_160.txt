Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]10/21/2022[O] at 3:30 PM. HISTORY: [B-AGE]54-year-old[O] female presenting with new onset seizures and headaches. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]8/15/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: 1.5 Tesla multiparametric MRI was performed with and without the administration of Gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There is a [B-AGE]2.5 cm[O] enhancing mass in the right frontal lobe, characterized by irregular borders and surrounding vasogenic edema. The mass effect causes mild midline shift toward the left. There is no evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarct. The ventricular system is symmetric and age-appropriate without signs of transependymal fluid migration. The cerebral sulci and cisterns appear normal. Comparison with the earlier study shows an increase in the size of the lesion from [B-AGE]2.0 cm[O]. IMPRESSION: 1. New growth of the right frontal lobe mass suggesting possible neoplasm. Further evaluation with biopsy and neurosurgical consultation recommended. 2. Increase in mass size since last assessment.
