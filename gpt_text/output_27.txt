Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]10/21/2022[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluate for changes post radiation therapy for metastatic brain lesions. COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]8/15/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla scanner using standard brain protocols with and without the administration of 15 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: There is a stable appearance of the previously noted brain metastases located in the right frontal lobe and left parietal lobe. Each lesion measures approximately 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, unchanged from prior examination. There is no evidence of new metastatic lesions. No significant midline shift or mass effect. Normal flow voids are present. The ventricular system is stable, and the sulcal and cisternal spaces are preserved. Post contrast images show no new areas of enhancement. IMPRESSION: 1. No significant interval change in the size or number of brain metastases. 2. No new metastatic disease noted. 3. Stable post therapeutic changes without evidence of progression.
