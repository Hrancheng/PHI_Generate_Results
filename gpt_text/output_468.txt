Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/22/2021[O]. INDICATION: Evaluate for possible intracranial pathology. HISTORY: Recent onset of severe headaches. COMPARISON: CT head dated [B-DATE]9/25/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed using a 3 Tesla system. Multiplanar, multisequence imaging was obtained through the brain with and without gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are normal in configuration. There is a 3 mm focus of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the white matter of the left frontal lobe, which is nonspecific but could represent a small area of gliosis or demyelination. No enhancing lesions are seen post-contrast. The major intracranial flow voids are maintained. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Small nonspecific focus of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, likely gliotic. Follow-up or further evaluation may be considered if clinically warranted.
