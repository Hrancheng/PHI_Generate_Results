Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI, [B-DATE]10/21/2021[O], 1:45 PM INDICATION: Evaluation for potential cardiomyopathy in a [B-AGE]53-year-old[O] male with a history of hypertension and recent abnormal EKG. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed with dynamic contrast enhancement to evaluate myocardial perfusion and to assess ventricular function. Images were obtained using a standardized cardiac protocol on a 3 Tesla system. FINDINGS: Left Ventricle: Normal size and wall thickness. Mild hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall. Left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 55%. No myocardial scar or delayed enhancement noted. Right Ventricle: Normal size and function. Valves: Mild mitral regurgitation. No significant aortic or pulmonic valve abnormalities. Pericardium: No pericardial effusion or thickening. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall of the left ventricle potentially indicative of ischemic heart disease. Recommended clinical correlation and consideration for stress test if clinically warranted. 2. Mild mitral regurgitation, no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.
