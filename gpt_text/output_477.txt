MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING - BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]10/18/2021[O] AT 9:00 AM CLINICAL INDICATION: Recurrent headaches and dizziness. COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]05/14/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: A high-resolution MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner using an extensive brain examination protocol from [B-ORGANIZATION]Mountain View Imaging Center[O]. The patient was administered 15 mL of Gadovist intravenous contrast without any adverse effects. FINDINGS: The brain parenchyma demonstrates normal morphology without evidence of mass, midline shift, or hydrocephalus. The ventricles are of normal size and configuration. There are no focal lesions or areas of abnormal signal intensity on either T1 or T2-weighted images. There is no abnormal enhancement post-contrast administration. The major intracranial vessels appear patent with normal flow voids. The basal cisterns are open. The sellar and parasellar regions are unremarkable. The visualized orbits and paranasal sinuses are free of disease. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Stable examination compared to the previous MRI dated [B-DATE]05/14/2020[O]. Recommendations: Continue routine clinical follow-up and re-evaluate if symptoms persist or worsen.
