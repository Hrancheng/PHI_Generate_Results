Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]7/14/2022[O] TIME: 14:45 PM INDICATION: Evaluation for myocarditis in a [B-AGE]56-year-old[O] male with recent COVID-19 infection. COMPARISONS: Echocardiogram [B-DATE]6/30/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla scanner with both T2-weighted and delayed enhancement sequences to assess for myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. ADMONITIONS: Precautions for kidney function due to contrast. FINDINGS: Presence of patchy mid-myocardial and subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement in the lateral wall of the left ventricle suggesting myocardial inflammation. No evidence of full-thickness fibrosis or myocardial infarction. Normal left ventricular size and systolic function with an ejection fraction estimated at 62%. Right ventricular size and function were also within normal limits. No pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Cardiac MRI findings compatible with myocarditis, likely post-viral associated with recent COVID-19 infection. 2. No evidence of chronic myocardial damage. Recommendations: Follow-up with cardiology for management of myocarditis. Potential therapeutic options include anti-inflammatory medications and monitoring of cardiac function.
