Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]07/15/2021[O] CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of new onset seizures. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]03/22/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI brain was performed with and without the use of 20 mL gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) at 3 Tesla. Axial, coronal, and sagittal images were obtained with high-resolution sequences. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute abnormality. No intercranial mass, hemorrhage, or significant midline shift. The ventricles and sulci appear normal in size and configuration. There is a stable appearance of known small arachnoid cyst in the left middle cranial fossa, measuring approximately 2 x 1.5 cm, unchanged from the previous MRI. MRI angiography shows normal vascular anatomy without evidence of vasculitis or aneurysm. Meninges appear normal. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial process. 2. Stable appearance of previously documented left middle cranial fossa arachnoid cyst. No significant change from previous MRI.
