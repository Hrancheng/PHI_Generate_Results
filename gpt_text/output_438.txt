Example 21:
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/15/2022[O] 14:20 PM INDICATION: Evaluation for abdominal pain and suspected appendicitis. HISTORY: Recurrent, severe lower quadrant abdominal pain. Prior exams unavailable for comparison. TECHNIQUE: Helical CT scan was performed from the diaphragm to the symphysis pubis using 100 mL of Visipaque 320 intravenous contrast, without complication. IMAGES were reconstructed at 2 mm slice thickness. FINDINGS: The visualized portions of the lower lung bases are unremarkable. There is no evidence of abdominal fluid collections, organomegaly, or significant lymphadenopathy. The appendix is not dilated or thickened, and no periappendiceal fat stranding is observed. The liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys exhibit normal morphology and attenuation without focal lesions. The bladder is normal in appearance. Mild diffuse bowel gas distention is noted, which may relate to mild ileus or altered bowel habits. BONES and SOFT TISSUES: No bony abnormalities or significant soft tissue findings. IMPRESSION: 1. No radiologic evidence of appendicitis. 2. Non-specific bowel gas distention, likely benign.

This example synthesizes a typical CT scan procedure and findings relevant for assessing abdominal complaints, specifically investigating appendicitis, while adhering to PHI de-identification guidelines by correctly labeling the date.
