Example 21:
MRI PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]7/5/2022[O] 11:00 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]32-year-old[O] female with chronic pelvic pain, suspect endometriosis. COMPARISON: MRI pelvis [B-DATE]12/20/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence MRI of the pelvis was performed before and after the administration of 15 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast. Images were acquired using a phased-array pelvic coil on a 3.0 Tesla scanner. FINDINGS: There is evidence of multiple peritoneal adhesions, predominantly involving the posterior cul-de-sac. Several T1 hyperintense and T2 shading nodules compatible with endometriosis are noted in the peritoneal lining around the bladder and near the rectosigmoid junction. The ovaries are of normal size with no dominant follicles or cysts. No adnexal masses or significant fluid collections are identified. The uterus appears anteverted and normal in morphology with no fibroids or intracavitary lesions observed. The bladder and rectum are normal. IMPRESSION: 1. Findings consistent with pelvic endometriosis with multiple peritoneal adhesions likely contributing to chronic pelvic pain. 2. No evidence of ovarian cysts or fibroids.
