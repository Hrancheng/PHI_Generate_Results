MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]7/10/2020[O] at 10:30 AM. INDICATION: [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] female with history of repeated migraines and visual disturbances. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated [B-DATE]3/15/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner using a standardized brain protocol with and without the administration of 15 mL of Gadovist contrast. 

FINDINGS: There is a stable appearance of a 1.2 cm cystic lesion in the right temporal lobe, unchanged in size and appearance from the prior examination. There is no evidence of surrounding edema or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size for patient's age. There is no midline shift. The major vascular structures demonstrate patent flow voids with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion. 

IMPRESSION: 
1. Stable right temporal lobe cyst, unchanged from previous study. 
2. No new focal neurological deficits or significant interval changes since the last MRI. 
3. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
