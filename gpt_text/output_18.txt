MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]10/21/2021[O] TIME: [B-TIME]08:45 AM[O] INDICATION: [B-AGE]72-year-old[O] female with history of chronic headaches and recent onset of visual disturbances. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated [B-DATE]5/15/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner using [B-ORGANIZATION]Memorial Health University Medical Center[O] standard brain protocol. Images obtained before and after administering 15 mL of Gadolinium contrast intravenously.

FINDINGS: 
There are multiple foci of hyperintense FLAIR signal in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, consistent with microvascular ischemic changes. There is no evidence of acute ischemia or hemorrhage. The basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem structures are within normal limits for age. The major intracranial vessels demonstrate patent flow voids, and there is no mass effect or midline shift. The pituitary and pineal glands are unremarkable. The visualized orbits and paranasal sinuses are clear. No abnormal enhancement is noted post-contrast.

IMPRESSION:
1. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes without acute abnormalities.
2. Stable appearance of the brain compared to the previous MRI dated [B-DATE]5/15/2019[O]. No new findings.
