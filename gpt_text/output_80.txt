Example 21:
MRI SPINE CERVICAL WO/W CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/15/2021[O] 4:00 PM INDICATION: [B-AGE]57-year-old[O] female with neck pain and radiculopathy. COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]7/20/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the cervical spine was performed using multi-sequence, multi-planar technique without and with contrast on a 1.5 Tesla machine. FINDINGS: The cervical spine shows normal cervical lordosis. No evidence of fracture or subluxation noted. Cervical intervertebral discs exhibit mild to moderate degenerative disc disease, most pronounced at the C5-C6 level, where there is a small central disc protrusion causing mild impingement on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac without significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The remaining cervical discs are unremarkable. The visualized portions of the spinal cord are normal in signal intensity and contour. There is enhanced signal following contrast in the vascular structures without any evidence of abnormal enhancement within the spinal canal. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild to moderate degenerative disc disease at the C5-C6 level with a small central disc protrusion. No significant neural impingement. 2. No acute abnormality on MRI of the cervical spine.
