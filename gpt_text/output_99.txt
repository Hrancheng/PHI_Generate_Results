Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI dated [B-DATE]9/27/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of potential myocarditis. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]8/15/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the heart was conducted using [B-ORGANIZATION]General Hospital Cardiac Imaging[O] specialized cardiac sequences. Images were gathered at multiple phases of the cardiac cycle without complication.

FINDINGS:
1. The left ventricular wall appears normal in thickness with no focal wall motion abnormalities. Normal left ventricular systolic function without dilation. Estimated ejection fraction is 55%.
2. The right ventricle is normal in size and function with no wall motion abnormalities.
3. No evidence of myocardial edema or delayed hyperenhancement suggestive of myocarditis or fibrosis.
4. Pericardium is normal without thickening or pericardial effusion.
5. Valves appear functional without significant regurgitation or stenosis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal cardiac morphology and function.
2. No MRI evidence of myocarditis.
3. Comparison with previous echocardiogram shows no significant interval change.
