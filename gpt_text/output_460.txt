Example 21:
EXAM: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]10/14/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Neurological evaluation for suspected multiple sclerosis. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]4/5/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multiple sequences in multiple planes including T1, T2 FLAIR, T2 Gradient-Recalled Echo, and T1 post-contrast using gadolinium-based contrast agent. FINDINGS: There are several new white matter lesions on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, predominantly in the periventricular and subcortical regions, which were not present on the prior study dated [B-DATE]4/5/2019[O]. The new lesions demonstrate enhancement post-contrast, suggesting active demyelination. No evidence of mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are within normal limits for patientâ€™s age. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New white matter lesions likely representing active demyelination, consistent with the progression of multiple sclerosis. 2. No features suggestive of alternative diagnoses such as tumor or stroke.
