Example 21:
MRI CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]2/15/2022[O] 10:30 AM
INDICATION: [B-AGE]52-year-old[O] male with recent trauma from a fall, experiencing neck pain and numbness in the upper extremities.
TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner without contrast.
FINDINGS: Alignment of the cervical spine is maintained with no evidence of fracture or subluxation. Cervical intervertebral discs show mild degenerative changes, most pronounced at C5-C6 level where there is a small central disc protrusion causing mild impingement on the ventral aspect of the spinal cord. No significant neural foraminal narrowing. The spinal cord exhibits normal signal intensity throughout. Vertebral body heights are preserved.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
2. Small central disc protrusion at C5-C6 mildly impinging on the spinal cord. No associated neural foraminal narrowing.
3. No acute fracture or malalignment.
MRI findings consistent with patient's symptoms of neck pain and numbness, related to traumatic and degenerative changes. Follow-up with [B-ORGANIZATION]City Spine Clinic[O] recommended for assessment and possible physical therapy.
