Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]04/15/2022[O] CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for possible metastases due to new neurological symptoms. History of lung cancer. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]02/21/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla machine. Sequences included FLAIR, T2*, DWI, and post-contrast T1 with 15 mL of Gadovist. FINDINGS: There are no new lesions. Stable appearance of previously noted small enhancing foci in the right parietal lobe, which are consistent with the known metastatic disease. Post-contrast images show no new areas of abnormal enhancement. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size. The basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem show normal signal intensity. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or acute infarction. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No new brain metastases identified since the prior study. 2. Stable known metastatic lesions. 3. No acute intracranial pathology.
