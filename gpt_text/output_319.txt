CERVICAL SPINE MRI [B-DATE]10/29/2022[O] TIMING: 15:30 Hrs INDICATION: Evaluation for radiculopathy. COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]08/15/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: Utilized T1, T2, STIR sequences in multiple planes through the cervical spine. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multilevel degenerative disc disease, most notable at C5-C6 with a small posterior disc protrusion contacting the ventral aspect of the spinal cord. No significant spinal cord compression or signal change within the cord. 2. C6-C7 shows mild disc bulge without significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. 3. The vertebral body heights and alignment remain stable with no evidence of acute fracture. 4. Normal signal intensity of the spinal cord and surrounding soft tissues. No paravertebral soft tissue mass or lymphadenopathy identified.
