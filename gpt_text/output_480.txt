Example 21:
CERVICAL SPINE MRI dated [B-DATE]10/15/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of chronic neck pain and rule out cervical radiculopathy. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]01/12/2018[O] and X-rays dated [B-DATE]07/29/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI was performed on the cervical spine without the use of intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: The vertebral body heights and alignment appear normal. Intervertebral discs show mild degenerative changes, most prominent at C5-C6 with a small central disc protrusion indenting the thecal sac but not compressing the adjacent nerve roots. No significant spinal canal stenosis is observed. Neural foramina are patent bilaterally. The cervical cord has normal morphology with no evidence of intrinsic signal abnormality. No mass, lymphadenopathy, or abnormal enhancement is detected. IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative disc disease at C5-C6 without significant nerve root compression or spinal canal stenosis. Stable comparison with previous studies suggests no progressive disease.
