Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]10/25/2021[O] TIME: 14:00 PM INDICATION: [B-AGE]55-year-old[O] male, evaluation for new-onset seizures. COMPARISON: MRI Brain from [B-DATE]02/12/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Imaging performed on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner utilizing sequences that included T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, and post-contrast T1 sequences with 15 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: There is evidence of a 1.2 cm enhancing lesion on the right temporal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema. The lesion demonstrates restricted diffusion and a ring-enhancing pattern post-contrast. No evidence of midline shift. Remaining brain parenchyma shows normal signal for age and gender. Ventricular sizes are within normal limits. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarct. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New 1.2 cm ring-enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe, suggestive of primary brain tumor or metastasis. Further evaluation with biopsy and full oncologic workup recommended. 2. No acute infarct or hemorrhage.
