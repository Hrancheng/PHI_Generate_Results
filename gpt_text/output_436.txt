Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI dated [B-DATE]02/14/2022[O] at 10:30 AM. HISTORY: Diagnosis of possible myocarditis in a post-viral syndrome scenario. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]01/10/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the heart was performed using dedicated cardiac coils on a 3 Tesla MRI system. Specific sequences included T2-weighted imaging for edema, cine sequences for cardiac function, and late gadolinium enhancement for fibrosis. Dedicated phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequences were used to assess myocardial inflammation. FINDINGS: VISUALIZED STRUCTURES: Biventricular size and function are within normal limits. There is no dilatation of the chambers. Myocardial wall thickness is normal. No regional wall motion abnormalities were noted. Late gadolinium enhancement shows a small, non-ischemic pattern of enhancement in the mid myocardial segments of the lateral wall, which is consistent with myocardial inflammation possibly due to myocarditis. No evidence of pericardial effusion. The cardiac valves appear structurally normal with no significant stenosis or regurgitation. Perfusion images show no significant inducible ischemia. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. MRI findings are suggestive of localized myocardial inflammation, likely secondary to post-viral myocarditis. 2. No evidence of significant cardiac dysfunction or ischemic heart disease. Follow-up with clinical correlation and possible repeat MRI in [B-DATE]6 months[O] is recommended to assess progression or resolution of inflammation.
