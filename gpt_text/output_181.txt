Example 21:
CHEST X-RAY (PA AND LATERAL) dated [B-DATE]10/14/2022[O], Time: 2:45 PM CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluated for persistent cough and fever. COMPARISON: Prior chest x-rays from [B-DATE]09/05/2022[O]. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are within normal limits for age. There are faint reticular markings in the base, suggesting mild interstitial changes, possibly early signs of an infectious process. Diaphragm and lung apices are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease. Recommend clinical correlation for persistent symptoms, and repeat imaging if symptoms persist or worsen. Follow-up x-ray may be needed if symptoms do not resolve or if there is escalation of symptoms.
