Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI, dated [B-DATE]09/15/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for myocardial ischemia. TECHNIQUE: Images acquired using a steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence together with late gadolinium enhancement technique to assess myocardial viability. IMPRESSION: FINDINGS: The left ventricular cavity size is within normal limits with normal wall thickness. Left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated at 60%. The right ventricle appears normal in size and function. Delayed enhancement images reveal a small area of mid-myocardial enhancement in the inferolateral wall suggestive of myocardial fibrosis, potentially indicative of prior myocardial infarction. The rest of the myocardium enhancers normally. No evidence of ventricular thrombus or pericardial effusion. Coronary arteries are visualized with normal origins and course without significant stenosis or obstructions. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal chamber sizes with preserved systolic function. 2. Small area of myocardial fibrosis in the inferolateral wall, likely representing a prior subclinical myocardial infarction. Professional recommendation: Follow-up with a cardiologist for further evaluation and management.
