Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]09/05/2022[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: [B-AGE]48-year-old[O] male with progressive memory loss and confusion. Comparison: MRI dated [B-DATE]05/30/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: Imaging performed on a 3 Tesla MRI unit using Alzheimer's protocol. FINDINGS: There is a mild general atrophy for [B-AGE]48 year[O] age with prominence of the ventricular system. Several small white matter foci are noted, consistent with chronic small vessel disease. No acute infarct or mass effect is observed. Diffusion-weighted imaging shows no evidence of acute ischemia. There is no abnormal enhancement post contrast administration. The hippocampal and parahippocampal structures appear symmetrical with no focal lesion or significant volume loss. The basilar cisterns and sulci are appropriately open for age. The major intracranial arteries demonstrate normal flow voids without evidence of stenosis or occlusion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild cerebral atrophy typical for patient's age. 2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No acute pathology noted. Recommendations: Follow-up with neurology to discuss potential management and further cognitive testing if clinical situation warrants. Further imaging may be scheduled as clinically indicated.
