EXAM: CERVICAL SPINE MRI [B-DATE]9/15/2022[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Persistent neck pain following motor vehicle accident. COMPARISON: Previous cervical spine MRI dated [B-DATE]5/10/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI cervical spine was performed utilizing multi-planar, multi-sequence imaging without the use of contrast. FINDINGS: The cervical vertebrae demonstrate normal alignment with no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. Discs from C2-C7 are intact with no significant disc herniation or neural foraminal narrowing. There is mild diffuse disc bulge at C4-C5 level but no significant impingement on the spinal cord or nerve roots. Marrow signal within visualized portions of the cervical vertebrae is homogeneous and within normal limits for [B-AGE]45-year-old[O] patient. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute cervical spine injury. 2.
