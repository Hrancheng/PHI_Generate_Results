MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]10/25/2021[O]. INDICATION: Evaluation of chronic headaches. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]05/13/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed using a high-resolution brain protocol with and without the administration of 15 mL of Gadavist contrast at the [B-ORGANIZATION]City Hospital Imaging Center[O]. FINDINGS: The MRI reveals no significant change in the appearance of the mild diffuse cerebral atrophy compared to previous scans. No new areas of abnormal enhancement or signal alteration within the brain parenchyma. The ventricular system is stable. The cerebral aqueduct and fourth ventricle appear normal. No evidence of mass effect, midline shift, or hydrocephalus. The major intracranial vascular structures demonstrate normal flow voids. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable mild diffuse cerebral atrophy. No acute intracranial pathology.
