Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]04/25/2022[O]. INDICATION: [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] female with headaches and visual disturbances. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated [B-DATE]02/03/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla system, images obtained pre and post-administration of 15 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: Enhancing lesion noted in the right parietal lobe measuring approximately 2.4 x 2.1 cm, showing increased signal on T2/FLAIR sequences. The lesion shows restricted diffusion, suggesting a high-grade glioma versus metastasis. No evidence of midline shift. Basal ganglia and thalami appear normal. No hydrocephalus or acute hemorrhage is evident. Ventricles and sulci are within normal limits for patient age. Normal vascular flow voids. IMPRESSION: 1. New enhancing right parietal lobe lesion, consider high-grade primary brain tumor or solitary metastasis. 2. No acute infarct or hemorrhage. 3. Recommended clinical correlation and possible biopsy for definitive diagnosis.
