Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]9/14/2021[O] 10:30 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] female with symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated [B-DATE]6/23/2021[O], [B-DATE]3/15/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla scanner using the [B-ORGANIZATION]Greenwich Neurology Center[O] brain MS protocol. Pre and post-contrast sequences were obtained without complication. FINDINGS: Multiple white matter hyperintensities observed in the periventricular and subcortical regions, consistent with demyelinating plaques. Largest lesion measures 12 mm located in the right frontal lobe. New lesion compared to previous study, located in the left parietal lobe, measures 7 mm. Post-contrast images show several enhancing lesions, suggesting active demyelination. Ventricular size and morphology are within normal limits. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New and enlarging demyelinating lesions consistent with active multiple sclerosis. 2. Continue disease-modifying therapy and follow up with neurology for further management.
