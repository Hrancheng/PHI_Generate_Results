Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]07/25/2021[O] 3:10 PM INDICATION: [B-AGE]54-year-old[O] female presenting with new-onset seizures and headaches. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain performed on a 3 Tesla using [B-ORGANIZATION]Memorial Healthcare Systems[O] standard brain protocol. Standard sequences including T1, T2, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging were obtained before and after the administration of 20 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: The MRI reveals multiple small white matter hyperintensities on FLAIR suggestive of microvascular ischemic changes. There is no evidence of acute ischemic stroke or hemorrhage. The ventricles are normal in size. No midline shift. The posterior fossa structures, including cerebellum and brainstem, appear normal. No abnormal meningeal enhancement or intracranial mass effect noted. IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple white matter hyperintensities likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No acute intracranial pathology identified. Recommend follow-up and further evaluation for vasculitis or migraine management as clinical symptoms persist.
