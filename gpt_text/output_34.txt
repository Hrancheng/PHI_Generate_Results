Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST - [B-DATE]10/5/2021[O] TIME: [B-DATE]14:30[O] INDICATION: [B-AGE]56-year-old[O] male with history of progressive memory impairment and suspected small vessel disease. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]4/12/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner using the [B-ORGANIZATION]Cleveland Clinic[O] standardized brain aging protocol. Images were obtained in multiple planes with and without gadolinium enhancement. FINDINGS: There is mild generalized cerebral atrophy more pronounced in the frontal lobes. Microvascular ischemic changes are seen predominantly in the periventricular white matter. There are no areas of abnormal enhancement to suggest active disease processes such as neoplasm, infection, or inflammation. Ventricular system is stable compared to previous examination, with mild enlargement consistent with ex vacuo from atrophy. Cerebellum and brainstem appear normal. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild generalized cerebral atrophy, with involvement more severe in the frontal lobes suggestive of an underlying neurodegenerative process. 2. Stable microvascular changes without new abnormal enhancement. Recommendation for clinical correlation with cognitive function tests and follow-up in one year or sooner if clinically indicated.
