Example 21:
URINARY BLADDER ULTRASOUND dated [B-DATE]10/7/2022[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for hematuria and suspected bladder stones. COMPARISON: Ultrasound dated [B-DATE]5/15/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Real-time grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound examination of the urinary bladder was performed. FINDINGS: The urinary bladder is normal in contour with a wall thickness of approximately 3 mm. No bladder masses or significant post void residual urine volume. The presence of three echogenic calculi each measuring less than 1 cm is noted at the bladder base, likely representing bladder stones. No evidence of ureteral jets obstruction was observed during the exam. IMPRESSION: 1. Presence of bladder calculi without evidence of obstruction. 2. No bladder tumors or significant post void residual. Recommendations for follow-up cystoscopy might be considered based on clinical symptoms.
