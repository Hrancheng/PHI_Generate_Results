Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]10/05/2023[O]. INDICATION: Evaluation of new onset seizures and headaches in a [B-AGE]32-year-old[O] male. COMPARISON: MRI dated [B-DATE]04/12/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla system using epilepsy protocol. Pre and post 20 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast administration was done without complication. Axial, sagittal, and coronal sequences obtained. FINDINGS: There is a new 1.2 cm focus of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity noted in the left temporal lobe without significant mass effect or midline shift. No abnormal enhancement is observed post-contrast. There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial fluid collections. Ventricles and basal cisterns appear normal. There is no evidence of prior surgical changes. IMPRESSION: 1. New focus of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the left temporal lobe indicative of possible glioma versus demyelinating process. Further evaluation with serial imaging and clinical correlation is advised. 2. No acute intracranial pathology observed.
