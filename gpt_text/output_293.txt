Example 21:
ABDOMINAL MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]11/21/2025[O]. INDICATION: [B-AGE]52-year-old[O] male with suspected hepatocellular carcinoma. HISTORY: Elevated liver enzymes, abnormal liver function tests. COMPARISON: Prior abdominal CT dated [B-DATE]8/15/2025[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the abdomen was performed both with and without 20 mL of Gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There is a 3.5 cm enhancing mass within the right hepatic lobe exhibiting arterial phase hyperenhancement and venous/late phase washout, characteristic of hepatocellular carcinoma. The remaining liver parenchyma demonstrates diffuse steatosis. No evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear unremarkable with no abnormal enhancement or masses noted. No free fluid or ascites. The visualized portions of the abdominal aorta are normal in caliber without evidence of aneurysm. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. 3.5 cm lesion within the right hepatic lobe consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. 2. Diffuse hepatic steatosis. 3. No other suspicious intra-abdominal pathology identified.
