Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST

Date: [B-DATE]10/15/2022[O]

COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated [B-DATE]07/13/2022[O]

INDICATION: Evaluation for progression of known glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain was performed with a 1.5 Tesla system. Sequences included axial, coronal, and sagittal T1 with and without gadolinium, T2 FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging.

FINDINGS:
- There is an increase in the size of the enhancing mass in the right frontal lobe measuring 3.2 x 4.1 x 4.5 cm, previously 2.9 x 3.8 x 4.1 cm.
- Surrounding vasogenic edema has also increased, extending into the right temporal and parietal lobes.
- Midline shift to the left has worsened from 3 mm to 5 mm.
- No new areas of abnormal enhancement suggesting distant metastasis.
- The ventricles are stable in size with mild transependymal flow consistent with ex-vacuo changes.
- No evidence of acute hemorrhage or recent infarction.

IMPRESSION:
1. Progression of size and extent of known right frontal GBM with increased surrounding edema and worsening midline shift.
2. Continued surveillance recommended with follow-up MRI in three months or sooner if clinically indicated.
3. Discussion for potential therapeutic adjustments recommended; please consult with the treating oncologist.
