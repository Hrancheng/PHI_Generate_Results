Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST [B-DATE]10/22/2021[O] TIME: 14:30 PM. INDICATION: [B-AGE]58-year-old[O] male with recurrent headaches and suspected cerebrovascular disease. COMPARISON: Previous MRI [B-DATE]03/15/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging of the brain was performed with and without the administration of 15 mL Gadavist. DWI, T2 FLAIR, T1 post contrast sequences included, using a [B-ORGANIZATION]Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania[O] standard brain protocol. FINDINGS: There is evidence of multiple small ischemic foci within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, particularly in the frontal lobes. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are normal for patient's age. There is a stable 5 mm pineal cyst as noted on prior studies. Post contrast images show no abnormal enhancement, suggesting no active inflammatory or neoplastic process. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple small ischemic white matter changes, likely chronic microvascular ischemic disease. 2. No evidence of acute infarcts, hemorrhage, or mass lesions. 3. Stable pineal cyst. Further clinical correlation and follow-up imaging as clinically indicated.
