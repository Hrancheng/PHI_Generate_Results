Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]09/15/2023[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluate myocardial viability post-myocardial infarction. TECHNIQUE: Dynamic cardiac MRI performed at [B-ORGANIZATION]Prestige Cardiac Imaging Center[O], utilizing late gadolinium enhancement and cine-MRI to assess myocardial function and fibrosis. COMPARISON: Previous [B-DATE]02/02/2023[O] cardiac MR imaging. FINDINGS: The left ventricle exhibits mild dilation with an end-diastolic diameter of 5.6 cm. Regional wall motion abnormalities are present in the inferolateral wall, suggesting myocardial scarring. Late gadolinium enhancement demonstrates a non-transmural late enhancement pattern in the same region, indicative of a fibrotic process but viable myocardium. The right ventricle and atria appear normal in size and function. No pericardial effusion. No evidence of thrombus in the cardiac chambers. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild left ventricular dilation and dysfunction with fibrotic changes in the inferolateral wall likely representing post-infarction scar. 2. Myocardium in the affected area appears viable.
