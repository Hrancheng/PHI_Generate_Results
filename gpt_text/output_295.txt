EXAM: MRI LUMBAR SPINE WO CONTRAST [B-DATE]02/15/2021[O] CLINICAL HISTORY: Low back pain with sciatica. COMPARISON: Prior MRI of the lumbar spine dated [B-DATE]08/10/2019[O]. TECHNIQUE: Lumbar spine MRI was performed without contrast. Axial and sagittal images acquired using standard protocols. FINDINGS: The L5-S1 disc demonstrates decreased disc height with moderate disc desiccation and a broad-based disc bulge. There is mild bilateral facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. No significant central canal narrowing. The neural foramina are patent. Minor annular tear noted at L4-L5 without evidence of herniation. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild degenerative changes at L5-S1 with disc bulge and facet arthropathy. 2. No evidence of nerve root impingement. Mild bilateral sciatica likely secondary to facet arthropathy.
