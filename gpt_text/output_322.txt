The vertebral bodies maintain normal height with preserved alignment. No significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable postsurgical changes at C4-C5 with no evidence of hardware complication. 2. No acute disc herniation or significant neural impingement. 3. Recommend follow-up as clinically indicated, possibly including physical therapy for ongoing symptoms.
