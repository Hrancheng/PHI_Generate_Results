Example 21:
EXAM: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated [B-DATE]10/15/2022[O]. CLINICAL HISTORY: Acute onset of left-sided weakness, assess for stroke. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated [B-DATE]1/12/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed with T1, T2, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted, and post-contrast sequences. MAGNETIC STRENGTH: 3 Tesla IMPRESSION: FINDINGS: There is a new area of restricted diffusion consistent with acute ischemic stroke affecting the right middle cerebral artery territory. Previous areas of encephalomalacia in the left cerebral hemisphere remain unchanged. No evidence of hemorrhage. The major vascular structures appear patent. The ventricles and sulci are normal for the patient's age. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New acute ischemic stroke in right MCA territory. 2. Stable chronic changes consistent with previous infarcts.
