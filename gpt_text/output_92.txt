Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]09/15/2020[O] 10:00 AM
INDICATION: Evaluation of [B-AGE]63-year-old[O] male with history of myocardial infarction and recent onset of atypical chest pain.
COMPARISON: Cardiac MRI dated [B-DATE]01/05/2019[O].

TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was completed using a 3 Tesla Siemens Skyra with cardiac gating, without and with administration of 15 mL Gadovist gadolinium contrast. Sequences included steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine, late gadolinium enhancement, and T2-weighted images.

FINDINGS: 
The left ventricle demonstrates normal systolic function with an ejection fraction estimated at 60%. There is no evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities. Late gadolinium enhancement imaging shows a small area of fibrosis in the basal inferolateral wall, consistent with an old myocardial scar. No additional areas of enhancement indicative of active or recent myocardial damage.

The right ventricle is normal in size and function.

The valves are structurally normal without significant stenosis or regurgitation.

Pericardium is normal without thickening or pericardial effusion.

There is a mild dilation of the ascending aorta measuring 3.8 cm. No aortic dissection flap or intramural hematoma is seen.

Coronary arteries are visualized with normal origins and no significant stenosis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Continued stability of the basal inferolateral scar without new myocardial damage.
2. Normal biventricular systolic function and valve morphology.
3. Mild ascending aortic dilation without acute complication; recommend follow-up imaging in [B-DATE]1 year[O].
