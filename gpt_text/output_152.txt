Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]10/21/2022[O] at 0915 hours. INDICATION: [B-AGE]55-year-old[O] female with history of myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Prior echo dated [B-DATE]8/15/2022[O]. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner using [B-ORGANIZATION]Central Hospital's[O] dedicated cardiac protocol. Sequences included cine, T2-weighted, and late gadolinium enhancement, performed according to standard operational procedures. FINDINGS: The left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated at 40%, indicative of mild systolic dysfunction. Areas of subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement were noted in the lateral wall, consistent with fibrosis secondary to the patientâ€™s prior myocardial infarction. No other areas of delayed enhancement suggesting active or chronic myocarditis. No pericardial effusion or significant valve disease was evident. Right ventricular size and function were normal. The thoracic aorta and visible upper abdominal structures were unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Cardiac MRI findings are consistent with known history of myocardial infarction with resultant mild cardiac remodeling and localized fibrosis in the lateral wall. 2. No new cardiac or pericardial abnormalities detected.
