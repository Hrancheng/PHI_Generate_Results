Example 21:
NEUROLOGICAL MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]10/25/2022[O]. INDICATION: Evaluation for multiple sclerosis. HISTORY: Progressive sensory disturbances and fatigue. COMPARISON: MRI Brain on [B-DATE]07/15/2021[O].
TECHNIQUE: MRI performed using a 3 Tesla machine with multi-sequence imaging in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Post-contrast sequences were obtained after IV administration of 15 mL Gadovist.
FINDINGS:
1. Several new white matter lesions visible on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, predominantly in the periventricular and subcortical regions.
2. No evidence of brainstem or cerebellar lesions.
3. No abnormal meningeal enhancement post-contrast.
4. Ventricles and sulci are within normal limits for patient age.
IMPRESSION:
1. New demyelinating lesions compatible with diagnosed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
2. No signs of acute infraction or malignancy.
3. Recommend clinical correlation with neurology for possible medication adjustment or therapy initiation.
RECOMMENDATION: Follow-up MRI in one year or sooner if clinically indicated.
