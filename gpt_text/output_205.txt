Example 21:
EXAM: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]4/28/2023[O] 10:15 AM INDICATION: [B-AGE]67-year-old[O] female with history of new-onset seizures and headache. COMPARISON: CT head dated [B-DATE]4/1/2023[O]. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI brain performed with and without 15 mL of Gadovist contrast, no complications. FINDINGS: The ventricles and sulci are normal in size for age. No evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage. There is a 2 cm enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema which likely represents metastatic disease. No significant midline shift. The pituitary and pineal glands are normal. The major intracranial arterial and venous flow voids are preserved. Minor chronic small vessel ischemic changes are noted. IMPRESSION: 1. New 2 cm enhancing right frontal lobe lesion highly suggestive of metastasis. 2. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. 3. Stable chronic small vessel changes. Follow-up with a specialty oncology consultation is recommended.
