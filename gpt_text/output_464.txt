Example 21:
ECHO HEART: Comprehensive Transthoracic Echocardiogram [B-DATE]2/15/2022[O] HISTORY: [B-AGE]63-year-old[O] male with history of hypertension and recent onset of atypical chest pain. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Standard transthoracic windows with use of spectral, color, and tissue Doppler imaging. FINDINGS: 
1. Left ventricular systolic function is normal with an estimated ejection fraction of 55%. 
2. No wall motion abnormalities are noted. 
3. The aortic valve is trileaflet and opens well; no significant aortic stenosis or regurgitation. 
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened but there is only trace mitral regurgitation. 
5. Chambers size and right heart pressures are normal. 
6. No pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: 
1. Normal left ventricular systolic function without wall motion abnormalities. 
2. Only trace mitral valve regurgitation with mild leaflet thickening.
3. No hemodynamically significant valvular disease.
4. Chamber sizes and function within normal limits.

Sedation and Analgesics were managed by [B-NAME]Dr. Sarah Connors[O] from [B-ORGANIZATION]Heart Health Services[O]. Patient monitored and stable throughout the procedure.
