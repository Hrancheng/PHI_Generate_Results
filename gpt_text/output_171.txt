Example 21:
CHEST X-RAY, [B-DATE]9/14/2021[O] at 10:35 AM. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for possible pneumonia. COMPARISON: Chest x-ray from [B-DATE]8/15/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Standard PA and lateral views were obtained. FINDINGS: The lungs are moderately hyperinflated but without evidence of acute focal airspace disease. There are no new pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable when compared to the previous study. The visualized osseous structures appear intact. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute pneumonia. 2. Stable hyperinflation of the lungs likely due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Suggested clinical follow-up and possibly a repeat x-ray if symptoms persist or worsen.
