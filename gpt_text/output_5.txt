Example 21:
THORACIC SPINE MRI [B-DATE]2/10/2022[O] - HISTORY: Frequent incidents of back pain due to previous trauma. Comparison: MRI from [B-DATE]6/25/2019[O]. FINDINGS: Examination of the thoracic spine from T1 through T12 reveals mild degenerative changes without significant stenosis or disc herniation. There is a mild curvature noted, likely idiopathic and not associated with trauma. No fractures or acute pathological findings are visualized in the thoracic vertebrae. The spinal cord exhibits normal morphology and signal intensity, with no evidence of cord compression or intradural lesions. The conus medullaris terminates at an appropriate level, and the cauda equina nerve roots appear without abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild degenerative changes in the thoracic spine without acute findings. 2. Stable when compared to the previous examination from [B-DATE]2019[O]. Further clinical evaluation recommended if symptoms persist.
