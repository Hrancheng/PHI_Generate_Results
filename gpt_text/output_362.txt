Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT - [B-DATE]07/15/2021[O]
CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected congestive heart failure.
COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]03/21/2020[O].

FINDINGS:
LEFT VENTRICLE: The left ventricular cavity size is normal with preserved systolic function. Estimated ejection fraction is 55%. No wall motion abnormalities.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal size and function of the right ventricle. No tricuspid regurgitation.

VALVES: Mild mitral regurgitation. The aortic valve is trileaflet with mild aortic regurgitation. Pulmonic valve is normal.

ATRIUMS: The left and right atriums are normal in size.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

OTHER: No intracardiac mass or thrombus. Aorta is of normal size with no evidence of dilation.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal left ventricular size and systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55%.
2. Mild mitral and aortic valve regurgitation.
3. No pericardial effusion.
4. Overall normal echocardiogram with no significant change compared to previous study dated [B-DATE]03/21/2020[O]. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Continue current medical therapy and follow-up as clinically indicated.
Review of symptoms and clinical status to be completed during follow-up visits.
