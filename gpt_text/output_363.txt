Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM DOPPLER STUDY [B-DATE]9/10/2021[O] TIME: 09:30 AM. CLINICAL HISTORY: Evaluation for left ventricular function due to suspected cardiomyopathy. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: 2D, M-Mode, and Doppler echocardiography performed with the patient in left lateral decubitus position. FINDINGS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated at 55% with normal left ventricular systolic function. No regional wall motion abnormalities. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right ventricle is normal in size and function with no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. All four cardiac valves exhibit normal morphology without significant stenosis or regurgitation. Pericardium appears normal without effusion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Normal left ventricular systolic function. 2. Mildly dilated left atrium but no evidence of significant valvular heart disease. 3. No pericardial effusion.
