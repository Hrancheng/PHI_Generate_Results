VENTRICULOPERITONEAL SHUNT SERIES dated [B-DATE]04/28/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for shunt malfunction in a [B-AGE]7-year-old[O] with previous hydrocephalus treatment. COMPARISON: Last shunt series from [B-DATE]03/01/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: Serial X-rays taken from skull to abdomen to trace the path of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter. FINDINGS: The proximal catheter tip is well positioned in the right lateral ventricle. The catheter traverses the neck without kinking or discontinuity, descending into the abdomen where the distal tip lies in the peritoneal cavity without evidence of displacement. There is no break or dislocation along the entire length of the shunt. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction or displacement. Catheter well positioned from ventricular entry to peritoneal endpoint.
