Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]09/15/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected myocarditis. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram dated [B-DATE]08/10/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed using a 1.5 Tesla scanner according to the [B-ORGANIZATION]Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre[O] established myocarditis protocol. Images were obtained using both T2-weighted and late gadolinium enhancement techniques after the administration of 0.2 mmol/kg of Gadovist. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Presence of late gadolinium enhancement in the basal to mid inferolateral wall suggestive of myocardial fibrosis or scar, compatible with clinical suspicion of myocarditis. 2. Normal left and right ventricular sizes and systolic function with ejection fractions of 64% and 62%, respectively. 3. No evidence of pericardial effusion.
