Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]11/29/2021[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of recent onset headaches and visual disturbances. COMPARISON: MRI Brain dated [B-DATE]10/01/2021[O]. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed using a 3 Tesla magnet employing standard brain protocol sequences with and without the administration of 15 mL Gadavist. FINDINGS: The brain parenchyma demonstrates normal gray and white matter differentiation without evidence of mass effect or midline shift. There are no signs of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. The ventricular system is stable and within normal limits. No abnormal enhancement is seen post-contrast. The pituitary gland appears normal with an intact pituitary stalk. Visualized orbits are unremarkable. Sinuses show mild mucosal thickening. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No significant interval change from prior study [B-DATE]10/01/2021[O]. 2. Normal MRI Brain without evidence of intracranial pathology that could explain the patient's recent symptoms. Continued neurological monitoring and clinical correlation recommended.
