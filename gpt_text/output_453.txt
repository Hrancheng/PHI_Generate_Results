Example 21:
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, [B-DATE]11/20/2022[O]. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of new-onset seizures. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Standard MRI sequences including T1, T2, FLAIR, and diffusion imaging performed with and without gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulcal spaces are normal in size and configuration. No mass effect or midline shift is observed. There are several nonspecific white matter hyperintensities on FLAIR images, which are not specific and could be related to small vessel ischemic changes. No abnormal enhancements are seen post-contrast. The basal ganglia, thalami, brainstem, and cerebellum appear normal. Orbits are included in the field of view and are unremarkable. The paranasal sinuses show mild mucosal thickening. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial abnormalities. 2. Nonspecific white matter hyperintensities likely related to small vessel ischemic changes. Recommendations: Clinical correlation for the significance of white matter changes and appropriate follow-up as indicated.
