Example 21:
MRI CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated [B-DATE]9/14/2022[O] at 10:30 AM. INDICATION: [B-AGE]32-year-old[O] female with chronic neck pain, rule out herniated disc. COMPARISON: MRI cervical spine dated [B-DATE]3/12/2020[O]. TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, and axial T2-weighted images of the cervical spine were obtained without the use of contrast. FINDINGS: Alignment of the cervical spine is maintained with normal curvature. There is no evidence of significant disc herniation, spinal canal stenosis, or nerve root impingement. The vertebral bodies maintain normal height and marrow signal. The intervertebral discs display normal hydration with no significant disc desiccation or bulging. The facet joints appear normal. The visualized portions of the spinal cord have a normal signal without evidence of intramedullary lesions. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No significant abnormality detected in the cervical spine. 2. Stable when compared to previous imaging. Recommendations: Continue conservative management and follow-up as symptoms warrant. Follow-up MRI in one year or sooner if symptoms increase in severity.
