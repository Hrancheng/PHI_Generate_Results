Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI [B-DATE]7/22/2021[O] - INDICATION: Evaluation for myocarditis given recent viral infection symptoms. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the heart with and without gadolinium-based contrast, following standard cardiac imaging protocols.

FINDINGS: 
1. Myocardial structure: The left and right ventricular size, wall thickness, and function are within normal limits. 
2. Valves: All cardiac valves appear morphologically normal with no significant stenosis or regurgitation.
3. Pericardium: No pericardial thickening or effusion noted.
4. Major vessels: The aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in caliber.
5. Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE): There is a patchy, non-ischemic pattern of enhancement in the lateral wall of the left ventricle suggesting myocardial inflammation consistent with myocarditis.

IMPRESSION:
1. MRI indications of myocarditis with features of inflammation observed in the lateral wall of the left ventricle.
2. Normal cardiac chamber sizes and valvular function.

FOLLOW-UP: Recommend clinical follow-up and possibly a repeat MRI in [B-DATE]3 months[O] to monitor resolution of inflammation. Ensure patient adherence to prescribed anti-inflammatory medications and limit strenuous activities as discussed.
