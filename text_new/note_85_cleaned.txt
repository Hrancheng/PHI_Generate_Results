Ms. Emily Harris was admitted with chest pain and severe shortness of breath. Upon arrival, serial troponins were elevated, and emergent coronary angiography indicated significant stenosis, leading to stent placement in the left anterior descending artery. Post-procedure, her heart function improved, but she required management for ensuing congestive heart failure. Treatment included IV diuretics and initiation of beta-blocker therapy.
Ms. Harris responded well with an improvement in her ejection fraction noted from initial echocardiography comparison, stable without recurrence of chest pain. Physical therapy and dietetic consultation were part of the care to address her heart failure management and general strength conditioning.
