68-year-old female presented with an acute exacerbation of COPD on 2/15/2023 due to non-compliance with medication regimen. On arrival, severe dyspnea and use of accessory muscles noted. Saturations improved with bipap and nebulizations. 
**Brief Hospital Course (including treatment rendered and response to treatment):**
Mrs. Cahill was admitted under the General Medicine service and transferred to the respiratory unit for close monitoring due to acute COPD exacerbation. Intravenous steroids and antibiotics were administered, with a favorable response observed, and transition to oral medications completed successfully by day 5. Diuresis was managed for minor pedal edema believed to be related to heart strain from chronic lung disease.
Patient responded well to treatment with marked improvement in breath sounds and reduction in wheeze; however, moderate use of accessory muscles persisted, showing a need for ongoing outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.
