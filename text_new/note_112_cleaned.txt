**Hospital Course: Brief Overview**
Mrs. Evelyn Roberts was admitted to the cardiac care unit following the onset of severe chest pain characterized by tightness radiating to her left arm. Upon arrival, an immediate EKG confirmed ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), and she was taken to the catheterization lab where she underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to her left anterior descending artery. 
Post-procedure, she was initiated on dual antiplatelet therapy and guideline-directed management for heart failure and diabetes. Her in-hospital course was complicated by transient acute kidney injury, likely contrast-induced, which resolved with hydration and careful management of her diuretics.
