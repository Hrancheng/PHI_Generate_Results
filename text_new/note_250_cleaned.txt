### Hospital Course:
Martha Jenkins, a 72-year-old female, was admitted to our facility on September 15, 2023 with a chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath and chest discomfort. Upon admission, she was found to have an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Cardiology was consulted, and an echocardiogram showed decreased ejection fraction of 35%.
During the stay, Mrs. Jenkins underwent optimization of her heart failure medications. Lasix was increased to 80 mg twice daily, which resulted in marked improvement in her symptoms and a decrease in peripheral edema. Serial troponin levels remained within normal limits throughout the admission.
