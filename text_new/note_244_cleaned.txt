**Hospital Course**:  
Mrs. Rodriguez was admitted after experiencing symptoms consistent with an acute myocardial infarction. Upon arrival, ECG abnormalities and elevated cardiac markers confirmed the diagnosis. She underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to her left anterior descending artery, which was successfully treated with a stent placement. Her recovery was stable, and she participated in daily cardiac rehabilitation sessions. She was managed for hypertension and hyperlipidemia with appropriate medical adjustments. There were no complications during her stay, and she progressively regained strength.

**Condition at Discharge**: Stable  
**Instructions**: Patient is to continue with cardiac rehabilitation outpatient. She is advised to maintain a low-sodium, low-cholesterol diet, and continue medications as prescribed. She should monitor her blood pressure and weight daily, and report any symptoms of chest pain, difficulty breathing, or excessive fatigue to her healthcare provider immediately.
