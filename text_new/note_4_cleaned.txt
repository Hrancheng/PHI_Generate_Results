**Hospital Course:**
Mr. Robert Anderson presented with chest pain characterized as severe, substernal, and radiating to his left arm. The pain onset was around 4 PM on August 6th, 2023.

A drug-eluting stent was successfully placed.
Post-procedure, the patient remained stable with significant relief from chest pain. He was started on dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin and ticagrelor, and statin therapy with atorvastatin. Cardiac rehabilitation was initiated early during the hospital stay and tolerated well.
Throughout the course, Mr. Anderson showed improvement in cardiac function as evidenced by echocardiography, which indicated an ejection fraction improvement from 40% upon admission to 50% at discharge. He participated actively in education sessions about lifestyle modification concerning diet and exercise for secondary prevention of cardiac events.
