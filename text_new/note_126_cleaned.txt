**Hepatology Inpatient Discharge Summary**
Robert Thompson, MRN# 982745329, is a 58 y.o. male, admitted to the Hepatology service for management of acute on chronic liver failure. Admission Date: 02/10/2023. Discharge Date: 02/20/2023. 
Attending Provider: Dr. Sara Kim
Treatment Team:
- Chief Resident: Dr. Emily Grant
Patient History:
- 58-year-old male with a known history of Hepatitis C and cirrhosis presented with symptoms of increased abdominal girth and jaundice. Paracentesis performed on admission revealed ascitic fluid consistent with portal hypertension.
Hospital Course:
- During hospitalization, Mr. Thompson underwent multiple paracenteses due to refractory ascites. He responded well to diuretic therapy which was adjusted based on his renal function. Nutritional support was managed by our dietitian due to patient's protein-caloric malnutrition.
- A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure was considered; however, due to the patient's complex condition and consultation with hepatology, it was deferred.
- No episodes of hepatic encephalopathy were observed. His condition was further complicated by a transient episode of acute kidney injury (AKI), likely due to pre-renal factors, which resolved following intravenous fluid administration.
Discharge Medications:
- Furosemide 40 mg tablet once daily
- Spironolactone 100 mg tablet daily
- Rifaximin 550 mg tablet twice daily to prevent hepatic encephalopathy
Outpatient Follow-Up:
