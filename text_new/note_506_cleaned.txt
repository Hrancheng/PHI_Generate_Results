**Hospital Course:**
Emily Thompson was admitted to our facility on August 15, 2023 with chest pain and diagnosed with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). Cardiology was consulted and she underwent coronary angiography which revealed two vessel disease, prompting the placement of drug-eluting stents in the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA). Her post-procedural course was notable for transient hypotension, managed conservatively with fluids. 
Her hospital stay was complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia, diagnosed on August 20, 2023, for which she was treated with intravenous antibiotics with satisfactory response. She was stepped down from the cardiac care unit to a regular floor on August 23, 2023 and continued to improve.

**Discharge Instructions:**
Emily Thompson is to follow a low-salt, low-fat diet, participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program, and avoid strenuous activities until cleared by her cardiologist. She was educated about the importance of medication adherence and lifestyle modifications in managing her heart disease.
