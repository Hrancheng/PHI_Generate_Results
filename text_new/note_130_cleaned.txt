- Admission Date: 10/23/2023  
- Discharge Date: 10/28/2023  
- Attending Physician: Dr. Harold Greene
**Admission Diagnosis:**  
Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
**Hospital Course:**  
Ms. Manning presented to the emergency department with increased shortness of breath and a productive cough on 10/23/2023. Her symptoms were consistent with an acute exacerbation of her known COPD. She reported a recent history of non-adherence to her inhaler regimen. Upon admission, her oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, and she was started on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula, resulting in an improvement in saturation to 94%.
She was treated with intravenous corticosteroids and antibiotics during her stay. Her hospital course was complicated by a transient episode of atrial fibrillation, which resolved with rate control. Pulmonary function tests indicated a moderate obstruction, with FEV1 at 65% expected. She responded well to treatment and was stepped down to oral medications.
**Discharge Medications:**  
- Salbutamol Inhaler: 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed  
- Prednisone: 40 mg orally daily for 5 days  
- Amoxicillin: 500 mg orally three times daily for 7 days  
- Warfarin: started with a loading dose, with INR target 2-3

- City Pulmonary Clinic, 450 Main Street, Springfield, IL 62701  
- Appointment Date: 11/03/2023, 10:30 AM with Dr. Susan O'Malley, Pulmonologist
**Discharge Instructions:**  
Patient has been instructed to continue oxygen supplementation at 2 liters per nasal cannula and to monitor her oxygen saturation twice daily. Dietary recommendations include a low sodium diet. Smoking cessation was strongly advised, with a referral to the City Hospital Smoking Cessation Program.
The importance of medication adherence was stressed, and the patient was educated on the proper technique for inhaler use. Signs of worsening symptoms such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever should prompt an immediate return to the emergency department.
