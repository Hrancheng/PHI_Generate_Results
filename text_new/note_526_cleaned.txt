His post-operative course was complicated by transient acute kidney injury attributed to contrast use, which resolved with hydration and medical management.

The patient participated in daily cardiac rehabilitation sessions and responded well to guideline-directed medical therapy.  **Discharge Medications:**   - Aspirin 81 mg daily   - Clopidogrel 75 mg daily   - Atorvastatin 80 mg nightly   - Metoprolol 50 mg twice daily   - Furosemide 40 mg daily as needed for fluid overload    **Discharge Instructions:**   Mr. Thompson is advised to follow a low-salt, heart-healthy diet, continue with outpatient cardiac rehabilitation, and monitor his weight daily.
