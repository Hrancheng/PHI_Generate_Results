**Hospital Course:**
Ms. Mitchell was admitted with a chief complaint of severe abdominal pain and diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on 7/23/2023, performed by Dr. Henry Wallace. Her postoperative period was complicated by mild hypotension, which responded well to IV fluids. She had no significant postoperative infections and her wound sites have healed well without signs of infection. Her pain was managed with scheduled acetaminophen and as-needed oxycodone, which she tolerated well.
Recovery was uneventful, and she was started on a light diet three days post-operation, which she tolerated without issue. Ms. Mitchell responded well to the treatment regimen and showed significant improvement, allowing for discharge preparations to begin a few days later.
