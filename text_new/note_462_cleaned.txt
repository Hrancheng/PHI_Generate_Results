**Chief Complaint:**  
Chest pain and elevated blood pressure
**Hospital Course:**  
Mr. Thompson was admitted on 10/05/2023 following an episode of severe chest pain and a recorded blood pressure of 190/100 mmHg at the local clinic. An initial ECG suggested left ventricular hypertrophy but was otherwise normal. Cardiology was consulted, and a cardiac catheterization was recommended and performed on 10/07/2023, revealing 70% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery. A drug-eluting stent was placed successfully.  
His hospital stay was complicated by a transient ischemic attack (TIA) on 10/10/2023, which resolved with no residual deficits. Neurology was consulted and recommended antiplatelet therapy. Blood pressure was managed with IV medication and transitioned to oral before discharge.  
Nephrology also evaluated Mr. Thompson due to acute kidney injury likely due to contrast but has shown improvement with IV fluids.
