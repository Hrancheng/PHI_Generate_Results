The patient's hospital course included management of fluid status with aggressive diuresis resulting in a weight reduction from 98 kg to 91 kg, achieving a euvolemic state. His rate-controlled atrial fibrillation has been stable since initiation of antiarrhythmic medication with no further episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation noted. Echocardiogram demonstrated preserved ejection fraction with signs of grade II diastolic dysfunction. Discharge planning included close outpatient follow-up and monitoring of kidney function given ongoing diuresis and potential nephrotoxicity of medications.    **Discharge Medications:**   - Furosemide 40 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth twice daily   - Dofetilide 500 mcg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth twice daily   - Lisinopril 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth once daily   - Potassium Chloride 20 mEq tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth once daily    **Follow-Up Instructions:**   Dr. Melissa Grant instructed Robert Parker to follow up in her office in 1 week, to ensure proper adjustment of medications and to evaluate his response to the new heart failure regimen.
