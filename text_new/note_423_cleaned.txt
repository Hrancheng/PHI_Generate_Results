The patient reported minimal pain which was managed with acetaminophen.  
Physical Therapy started on 10/23/2023 and continued daily, focusing on gentle mobilization and strength training. Mrs. Thompson showed good progress and was able to perform light activities with some assistance by 10/28/2023. Her cardiovascular status was monitored and remained stable throughout her stay.  
Psychological Services were also involved due to the patient expressing feelings of anxiety and fear of falling again. Counseling sessions were held and coping strategies were reviewed.  
The patient was advised to follow up with her primary care physician, Dr. Susan O'Neil, and her orthopedic surgeon within one week of discharge for wound check and functionality assessment of her wrist.
