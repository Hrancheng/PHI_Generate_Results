Mr. Emily Thompson presented to City General Hospital with chest pain characterized as substernal, exertional with shortness of breath. On admission, her EKG showed new T wave inversions in the anterior leads. She was immediately started on dual antiplatelet therapy and a statin. Given her risk factors and initial cardiac biomarkers, which were elevated, she underwent coronary angiography that showed a 70% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery.
