An initial ultrasound confirmed the presence of gallstones and signs of inflammation. The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on 9/17/2023, performed by Dr. Richard Kim. The procedure was without complications, and the pathology report confirmed chronic inflammation with cholelithiasis.  Her postoperative course was marked by moderate pain managed with IV acetaminophen and, later, oral ibuprofen. She tolerated a gradual return to a solid diet and was ambulating within 24 hours post-surgery. Her liver function tests normalized by 9/22/2023, and she remained afebrile throughout her stay.  **Discharge Medications:** - Ibuprofen 400 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours as needed for pain. - Acetaminophen 500 mg tablet: Take 1-2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours as needed for fever or pain.  **Follow-Up:** Mrs. Emily Thomas will follow up with her primary care provider, Dr. Laura Gonzalez, in two weeks or earlier if she experiences increased pain, fever, or any signs of infection. Please have Mrs. Thomas call 555-623-7753 to schedule this appointment. She is also scheduled for a follow-up visit with Dr. Richard Kim in one month to check the surgical site and overall recovery progress.  **Instructions for Home Care:** Mrs. Thomas is encouraged to avoid lifting weights over 10 pounds and rigorous exercise for at least 4 weeks. She should continue a low-fat diet for the initial few weeks after surgery to facilitate gradual adaptation of her digestive system.  **Discharge Condition:** The patient's condition at discharge was stable. She was alert and oriented, with pain well-controlled. There were no signs of infection observed at the surgical site.  **Discharge Time: 9/25/2023, 11:30 AM**  **Signed:** Dr. Helen Zhou, MD 9/25/2023, 12:00 PM  **Metropolitan General Hospital**
