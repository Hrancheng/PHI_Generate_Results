The patient was treated with intravenous diuretics with good response and had her home medications adjusted.   Intravenous therapy was transitioned to oral diuretics as her kidney function stabilized and symptoms improved. Throughout her hospital stay, Mrs. Thompson underwent daily weight and fluid balance monitoring.  A follow-up echocardiogram showed stable left ventricular ejection fraction compared to prior studies. A cardiac catheterization was not performed given her stable coronary artery disease status documented in prior angiography from 2019.  **Discharge Medications:**  - Furosemide 40 mg twice daily - Potassium Chloride 20 mEq daily - Metoprolol Succinate 50 mg daily - Lisinopril 20 mg daily  **Discharge Disposition:** Home  **Follow-Up Appointments:**  - Cardiology outpatient follow-up with Dr. Jenny Kim on 10/05/2023. - Nephrology follow-up with Dr. Aaron Miles on 10/10/2023.  **Discharge Instructions:**  Mrs. Thompson is advised to monitor daily weights and to adhere strictly to the fluid restriction of 1.5 liters per day.
