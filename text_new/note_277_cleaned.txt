Inpatient Discharge Summary 
Marilyn Torres, MRN# 857496123, a 45-year-old female, was admitted to Mercy General Hospital due to a high fever and severe abdominal pain. Her admission date was August 15th, 2023 and her discharge date is August 21st, 2023.
**Attending Physician**: Dr. Elijah Goldman
**Consulting Team**: Gastroenterology, Infectious Diseases
**Nursing Station**: 2nd Floor, Station 4
**Discharge Navigator**: Tina Rodriguez, RN
### Hospital Course:
Ms. Torres was admitted through the Emergency Department after presenting with fever (Temp: 102.4°F) and severe, localized lower right quadrant pain. Initial imaging studies included an ultrasound that indicated an inflamed appendix. Consulting with Gastroenterology led to a laparoscopic appendectomy performed on August 16th, 2023. Intra-operatively, a ruptured appendix was identified, and appropriate surgical clearing and antibiotic therapy commenced post-surgery.
She received post-surgery care in the post-operative recovery unit before being transferred to the general ward. Antibiotic therapy with IV Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole was administered throughout her stay, and she responded well to treatment. Her pain was managed throughout with PRN acetaminophen and ibuprofen, steadily decreasing in intensity, and no significant occurrences of nausea or vomiting were noted.
### Discharge Instructions:
Ms. Torres is being discharged with recommendations for rest, hydration, and continuation of oral antibiotics for seven more days. She is advised to monitor her temperature and wound site for any signs of infection. Pain is expected to decrease gradually, but she is prescribed oral Paracetamol 500 mg taken every 6 hours as needed for pain not exceeding 3000 mg per day.
**Follow-up appointments are scheduled with:**
- Dr. Rachel Harwood on August 28th, 2023 at Mercy General Outpatient Clinic
- Gastroenterology on September 5th, 2023
**Contact**: Should you have any concerns or worsening symptoms, please contact Nurse Emily Tran on (555) 414-7788.
### Discharge Medications:
- Amoxicillin 500 mg capsule, Take one capsule three times daily for 7 days 
- Paracetamol 500 mg, Take one tablet every 6 hours as needed for pain
**No known drug allergies**
**Physician's Remarks**: The surgical site appears clean and well-healed. No signs of infection. Her inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) have trended down post-operatively, indicative of a resolving infection.
### Summary:
The patient’s course of hospitalization was complicated by an early post-operative fever which resolved after initiation of IV antibiotics. Ms. Torres exhibited good recovery, responding well to surgical and antibiotic therapy. Her pain management has been effective, and she is advised to gradually resume normal activities, avoiding strenuous efforts for at least two weeks.
