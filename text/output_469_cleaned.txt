Example 21:
ECHO CARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 03/15/2022. INDICATION: Evaluation of left ventricular function due to recent complaints of fatigue and dyspnea. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: The overall left ventricular systolic function is normal with an estimated ejection fraction of 55%. There is no evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities. The left atrium and right atrium are normal in size. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. The aortic root is normal in size, and the aortic valve is trileaflet with no significant stenosis or regurgitation observed. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, however, there is only mild mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve is normal with trivial regurgitation. The pulmonary valve is unremarkable, with no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Pericardium is clear without any signs of effusion. Doppler studies show normal diastolic function. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55%. 2. Mild mitral regurgitation due to leaflet thickening. 3. Trivial tricuspid regurgitation. No pulmonary hypertension or pericardial effusion is evident.
