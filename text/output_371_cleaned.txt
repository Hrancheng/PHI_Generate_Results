EKG INTERPRETATION AND ANALYSIS dated 09/05/2022.  
CLINICAL INDICATION: 67-year-old male with palpitations and a history of atrial fibrillation.  
COMPARISON: EKG from 02/14/2021.  
FINDINGS:  
1. Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of approximately 110 bpm.  
2. Normal axis and intervals.  
3. No significant ST-T wave changes observed.  
4. Ventricular pre-excitation pattern is not evident.  
5. The comparison with the previous EKG shows a new onset of atrial fibrillation  
6. Chest X-ray indicated to exclude any potential pulmonary causes of palpitations.  
IMPRESSION:  
1. New atrial fibrillation without rapid ventricular response.  
2. No evidence of ischemic changes or other acute findings on the current EKG compared to February 2021.  
3. Recommend echocardiogram to assess atrial size and rule out structural heart disease.  
4. Consider initiating anticoagulation in the context of CHA2DS2-VASc score.  
5. Follow-up in the outpatient cardiology clinic for further management.
