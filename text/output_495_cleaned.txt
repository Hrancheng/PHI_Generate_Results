ECHO CARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 09/15/2021 10:30 AM
INDICATION: 68-year-old male with history of chronic heart failure and recent worsening of dyspnea.
COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated 03/12/2021.
TECHNIQUE: Standard echocardiographic views were obtained using the City Hospital cardiac imaging protocol.
FINDINGS:
1. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction: Reduced to approximately 35% consistent with global hypokinesis, slightly worse compared to prior ejection fraction of 40%.
2. Valvular Function: Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and mild aortic stenosis without significant hemodynamic compromise.
3. Dimensions: Left atrial enlargement noted, consistent with chronic pressure overload.
4. Additional Findings: No evidence of pericardial effusion. Normal right ventricular size and function.
IMPRESSION: 
1. Deterioration in left ventricular systolic function with ejection fraction decreased from 40% to 35% when compared to the last exam.
2. Chronic valvular changes with no acute abnormalities requiring immediate intervention.
3. Advised follow-up with cardiologist for possible medication adjustment and closely monitor symptoms of heart failure.
FOLLOW-UP: 
Patient is to schedule a follow-up visit within 3 months and earlier if symptoms worsen.
