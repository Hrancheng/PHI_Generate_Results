Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 9/15/2021 10:30 AM INDICATION: 58-year-old male with history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. COMPARISON: Prior cardiac MRI dated 7/20/2020. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed using a 3 Tesla system with comprehensive cardiac imaging sequences including stress perfusion and late gadolinium enhancement. FINDINGS: The left ventricular function appears within normal limits with an ejection fraction of approximately 60%. Mild diffuse hypokinesis is noted. No significant myocardial edema or fibrosis is identified. The right ventricle shows normal function and size. The atria are of normal size and thickness without thrombus. The MI previously reported appears stable without any new evidence of ischemia. Coronary arteries were visualized with no new significant stenosis or occlusions. The valves show mild mitral valve prolapse with no significant regurgitation. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable post-myocardial infarction state with no new ischemic changes. 2. Mild mitral valve prolapse without significant hemodynamic consequences.
