Example 21:
**MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST** dated 11/11/2021.  
**CLINICAL INDICATION**: H/O migraine; evaluate for neurological changes.  
**TECHNIQUE**: MRI was performed utilizing a high-resolution 3T scanner. T1, T2, FLAIR sequences, and diffusion-weighted images were obtained through the brain, followed by administration of 10ml Gadovist contrast.  
**COMPARISON**: MRI Brain dated 12/07/2019.  
**FINDINGS**:  
1. No significant interval change in the appearance of the cerebral cortex and no new focal abnormality on the FLAIR sequences.  
2. The pituitary gland and stalk are normal in entirety without evidence of hypertrophy or lesions.  
3. The ventricular system remains unchanged with normal configuration and size.  
4. No evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage.  
5. Post-contrast images show no abnormal enhancement.  
6. Visualized orbits, and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable.
**IMPRESSION**:   
1. Stable MRI of the brain with no acute intracranial pathology.  
2. Continuation of current management for migraines is recommended.  
3. Follow-up as clinically indicated.
