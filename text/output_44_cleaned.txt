Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 9/28/2021. INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram dated 8/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: A cardiac MRI was performed using a 3.0 Tesla MRI system, with the administration of 20 mL of Gadovist intravenous contrast without any adverse reaction. FINDINGS: The left ventricular function is preserved with an ejection fraction of 60%. No wall motion abnormalities are noted. The myocardium is uniform in thickness and texture without evidence of scarring or infarction. The right ventricle, atria, and valvular structures appear normal. The pericardium is unremarkable without pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal cardiac MRI with no signs of myocardial infarction or ischemia. 2. Stable cardiac structure in comparison to previous imaging.
