Example 21:  
MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 01/20/2022. CLINICAL INDICATION: Chronic low back pain with suspected disc herniation. COMPARISON: MRI lumbar spine dated 06/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed of the lumbar spine utilizing a combination of T1 and T2 weighted sequences, without the use of contrast. A total of 120 mL of saline was used for line flushing before and after the procedure. FINDINGS: The lumbar spine demonstrates normal vertebral body alignment. At L4-L5, there is evidence of a moderate-sized posterior disc protrusion which impinges upon the thecal sac but does not result in significant neural foraminal narrowing. No overt nerve root impingement is noted. Mild facet hypertrophy is seen at L3-L4 and L5-S1 but without significant stenosis. Remaining lumbar intervertebral discs exhibit normal height and signal intensity. Conus medullaris terminates at an appropriate level and appears normal in morphology. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable moderate-sized posterior disc protrusion at L4-L5. No significant progression compared to prior study dated 06/15/2021. 2. Mild facet hypertrophy without significant central or foraminal stenosis.
