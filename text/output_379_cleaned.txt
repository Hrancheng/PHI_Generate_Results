Example 21:
PROSTATE MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 10/15/2020. INDICATION: Increased PSA levels. COMPARISON: Ultrasound 8/20/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the prostate was performed using a 3 Tesla machine, including T1, T2, and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, followed by administration of Gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: The prostate gland is enlarged, measuring 4.2 cm in transverse dimension. There are several hypointense areas on T2-weighted images in the peripheral zone, compatible with prostate cancer foci. The largest focus measures approximately 1.0 x 0.5 cm. No evidence of extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion. The visualized pelvic lymph nodes are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Likely multifocal prostate cancer, without evidence of extraprostatic extension. 2. No lymphadenopathy or distant metastases seen. Continued surveillance and tissue confirmation recommended.
