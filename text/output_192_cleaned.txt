Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 10/22/2022 TIME: 14:45 PM INDICATION: 65-year-old female with history of chronic migraines and recent increase in headache frequency. COMPARISON: MRI brain dated 8/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: MRI brain was performed on a 3 Tesla machine using standard brain protocol including T1, T2, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences preceding and following the administration of 15 mL of Gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci appear normal for patient's age. There is a small non-enhancing white matter hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, likely representing small vessel ischemic change. No significant mass effect or midline shift. The posterior fossa structures are unremarkable. The major intracranial vessels appear patent with no evidence of stenosis or aneurysm. The pituitary gland and sella are normal. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Stable appearance of non-specific white matter hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe compared to previous imaging. Recommended clinical correlation for headache management.
