Example 21:
CHEST CT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 10/13/2022 
CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of pulmonary nodules detected on prior imaging. 
COMPARISON: CT scan dated 07/19/2022.
TECHNIQUE: Helical CT scan from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen using IV contrast, followed by a high-resolution scan without contrast.
FINDINGS:
- Lungs: A 15 mm non-calcified nodule in the right upper lobe without significant change in size since the last examination. Subtle ground-glass opacities noted in the left lower lobe.
- Mediastinum: No significant lymphadenopathy or masses.
- Pleura: No evidence of pleural effusion or thickening.
- Heart: Normal cardiac silhouette.
- Other: No other significant findings.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable 15 mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe. Recommend continued surveillance.
2. New ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe, likely inflammatory. Suggest clinical correlation and follow-up imaging if symptoms persist.
