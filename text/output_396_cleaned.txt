CT ABDOMEN PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, 9/15/2023 10:30 AM 
INDICATION: 58-year-old male with history of abdominal pain and weight loss. 
COMPARISON: CT scan 7/10/2022. 
TECHNIQUE: Multi-phase CT scan was performed of the abdomen and pelvis using 100 mL of nonionic contrast, followed by a 20 mL saline chase. Images were obtained and reconstructed in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. 
FINDINGS: 
Liver: No focal lesions detected. Mild diffuse liver steatosis.
Gallbladder: Normal without gallstones or biliary duct dilation.
Pancreas: Normal morphology and attenuation without visible masses or ductal dilatation.
Kidneys: Bilateral normal size and enhancement with no evidence of stones or obstruction.
Adrenal glands: Unremarkable.
Spleen: Normal in size and attenuation. 
Bladder: Normal in configuration; no evidence of thickening or masses.
Bones: No lytic or blastic lesions identified. 
Lymph nodes: No pathologically enlarged nodes evident.
Other: A small amount of free fluid is noted in the pelvis, likely physiological.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic pathology identified.
2. Mild diffuse steatosis of the liver. Further clinical correlation recommended.
3. Small amount of free pelvic fluid, likely physiological in origin.
