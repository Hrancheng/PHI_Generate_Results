ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 9/27/2021
HISTORY: 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyspnea on exertion.
COMPARISON: Echocardiogram 10/20/2019.
TECHNIQUE: Standard transthoracic echocardiogram with color Doppler.
FINDINGS: 
**Heart Chambers and Valves:**
- Left ventricular size is within normal limits with an ejection fraction estimated at 55%.
- No significant wall motion abnormalities noted.
- Mild left atrial enlargement is observed.
- The aortic valve appears to be trileaflet with mild-to-moderate calcific degeneration but without significant stenosis.
- Mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation are noted.
- The pulmonary valve is unremarkable.
**Great Vessels:**
- The aorta is normal in size and morphology. No evidence of aortic dissection.
- Pulmonary artery and veins are normal with no signs of pulmonary hypertension.
**Pericardium:**
- No pericardial effusion is detected.
IMPRESSION:
1. Ejection fraction preserved at 55%.
2. Mild left atrial enlargement likely due to hypertension.
3. Calcific changes in the aortic valve without hemodynamically significant stenosis.
4. Mild regurgitations noted across mitral and tricuspid valves but are not clinically significant at this stage.
5. No pericardial effusion.
6. Overall, the structure and function of the heart are within normal limits for the patientâ€™s age.
FOLLOW UP: Recommend clinical follow-up in one year or earlier if symptoms increase. Further imaging may be considered if there is a change in clinical status.
