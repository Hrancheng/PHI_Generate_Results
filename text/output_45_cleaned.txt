Example 21:
ULTRASOUND OF THE ABDOMEN dated 07/30/2022. CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected hepatomegaly. COMPARISON: Prior ultrasonography dated 03/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: The ultrasound examination included assessment of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys using both grayscale and Doppler modalities.
FINDINGS:
- Liver: Measure 18 cm in span, with a smooth contour and homogeneous echotexture. No focal lesions or hepatic duct dilatation were noted.
- Gallbladder: Normal in size and configuration with no gallstones or wall thickening.
- Common bile duct: Measures within normal limits, no dilatation.
- Spleen: Normal in size and echogenicity, measuring 11 cm.
- Pancreas: Normal in size, contour, and echogenicity. No pancreatic duct dilatation.
- Kidneys: Both kidneys are normal in size with clear differentiation between cortex and medulla. No hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
- Free fluid: No free fluid is apparent in the abdomen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Liver size at the upper limit of normal, consistent with clinical suspicion of hepatomegaly, however no underlying pathology detected.
2. No acute abdominal pathology identified.
3. Recommend clinical correlation and follow-up as needed.
