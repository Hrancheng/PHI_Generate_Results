ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 09/14/2022 
INDICATION: Evaluation of heart murmur and recent onset of dyspnea on exertion.
COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated 03/20/2021
TECHNIQUE: Standard transthoracic echocardiography with Doppler and color flow imaging was performed according to the protocol of General Hospital Cardiology Department. 
FINDINGS: 
- Left Ventricular Size and Function: The left ventricle is normal in size with mildly reduced systolic function. Estimated ejection fraction is 45%. No significant wall motion abnormalities were noted.
- Right Ventricular Size and Function: The right ventricle is normal in size and function.
- Valves: Mild mitral regurgitation. The aortic valve appears trileaflet with mild aortic stenosis. Tricuspid and pulmonary valves are normal.
- Atria: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is normal in size.
- Pericardium: No pericardial effusion.
- Aorta: The ascending aorta is normal in diameter.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis.
2. Mild enlargement of the left atrium.
3. Overall cardiac function within normal limits with noted findings specified.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Follow-up echocardiogram in one year or sooner if symptoms worsen.
- Clinical correlation with physical examination findings and consideration of additional imaging or cardiology consultation as deemed necessary by the treating physician.
