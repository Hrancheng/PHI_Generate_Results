Example 21:
CARDIAC ECHOGRAPHY dated 02/14/2020. INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected left ventricular hypertrophy and assessment of ejection fraction. HISTORY: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram dated 02/15/2019. FINDINGS: Normal left ventricular size with wall thickness at the upper limits of normal, consistent with mild hypertrophy. Ejection fraction is estimated at 60%. No valvular abnormalities or pericardial effusion. No intracardiac thrombus or masses. Normal right ventricular size and function. Normal atrial sizes. No evidence of intra or extra cardiac shunts. Normal pulmonary pressures. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy possibly related to hypertension. 2. Normal systolic function with an ejection fraction of 60%. 3. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
