**INDICATION:** 58-year-old female with a history of lower back pain and suspected lumbar spondylosis.  
**COMPARISON:** MRI lumbar spine dated 5/16/2019.

- Mild broad-based disc bulge at L3-L4 and L4-L5 without significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.  
- Facet joints at L4-L5 and L5-S1 show mild degenerative changes.  
- No acute disc herniation or nerve root impingement is evident.  
- The conus medullaris terminates at L1 without abnormal signal.  
- Incidental note is made of a 9 mm hemangioma in the body of L3.  
**IMPRESSION:**  
1. No significant change when compared to 5/16/2019. Mild degenerative disc disease as described above.  
2. Incidental hemangioma at L3, unchanged.
