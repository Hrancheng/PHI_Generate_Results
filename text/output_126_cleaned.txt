TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla unit with and without the administration of 15 mL of Gadavist. Sequences include T1 with contrast, T2, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging. FINDINGS: Several new T2 and FLAIR hyperintense lesions noted in the periventricular white matter compared to previous scan. No evidence of mass effect or midline shift. No abnormal meningeal enhancement. Ventricles and sulci are normal in size for 28-year-old patient. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New demyelinating lesions suggest progression of suspected multiple sclerosis. Recommended clinical correlation and neurological follow-up. 2. No acute intracranial pathology.
