Coronal and sagittal reformations were made. FINDINGS: The stomach and duodenum are normal in appearance. There are multiple dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 3 cm, with a transition point seen near the ileocecal valve, suggestive of small bowel obstruction. No free air or significant free fluid is noted. The colon is decompressed. There are no enlarged lymph nodes. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and bladder appear normal. There are no focal lesions or masses. The pelvic organs are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Evidence of small bowel obstruction with a transition point near the ileocecal valve. Recommend surgical consultation. 2. No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess or perforation.
