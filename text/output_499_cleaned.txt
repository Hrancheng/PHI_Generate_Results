MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 09/15/2021. INDICATION: Evaluation of persistent headaches and dizziness. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated 03/10/2021. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-plane MRI of the brain was performed using a 3 Tesla unit. There is prior administration of 15 mL Gadolinium-based contrast. FINDINGS: There is evidence of a small, stable meningioma measuring 2 cm in diameter in the right frontal region, unchanged from the prior study. No surrounding edema or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are within normal limits for patient age. There is no evidence of acute infarct, hemorrhage, or extra-axial fluid collections. Normal flow voids are seen in the major intracranial vessels. IMPRESSION: 1. No significant interval change in the size or appearance of the previously noted right frontal meningioma. 2. No acute intracranial pathology.
