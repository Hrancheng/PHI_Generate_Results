Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI without contrast, dated 4/15/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected myocarditis. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram 3/10/2021. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla scanner. Sequences included cine, T2-weighted, and late gadolinium enhancement. FINDINGS: The left ventricle shows normal size with an ejection fraction of 55%. There is mild hypokinesia of the basal inferolateral wall. Subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement is noted in the basal inferolateral segment, suggestive of myocarditis. The right ventricle and atria are normal in size and function. Valves appear structurally normal with no significant regurgitation or stenosis. Pericardium is normal without evidence of effusion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. MRI findings suggestive of myocarditis in the basal inferolateral wall of the left ventricle. 2. Normal ventricular size and function. 3. No pericardial effusion or significant valvular abnormalities.
