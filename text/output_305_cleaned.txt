Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 3/15/2020 at 10:30 AM. INDICATION: 58-year-old female with history of recurring migraines. COMPARISON: MRI from 6/15/2019. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed using multiplanar sequences without and with the administration of 15 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast. No complications noted during the procedure. FINDINGS: No significant interval change since the last MRI. There is no evidence of acute or chronic infarction. The ventricles and sulci appear normal for the patient's age. No masses, midline shift, or signs of increased intracranial pressure are evident. There are several tiny foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, consistent with migraine sequelae. No new lesions are identified. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial abnormalities. 2. Stable appearance of white matter lesions, likely attributable to migraine history.
