Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 07/25/2021 at 3:00 PM. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of chronic headaches and visual disturbances. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated 01/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: Multi-planar, multi-sequence MRI performed without and then with administration of 15 mL of Gadovist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: The brain parenchyma shows normal morphology without evidence of mass effect, midline shift, or abnormal enhancement. Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There are no intracranial masses or acute hemorrhagic changes observed. Several non-specific T2/FLAIR hyperintense white matter foci are seen, likely representing chronic small vessel ischemic changes. These features are stable when compared to the previous MRI. Visualized orbits, skull base, and major intracranial vasculature appear unremarkable. No abnormal enhancement suggestive of demyelinating disease or neoplasm. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No significant change from prior study with stable appearances of nonspecific white matter changes. 2. No evidence of acute pathology or enhancements that could explain the patient's symptoms. Further clinical correlation and possibly a follow-up study could be considered based on symptomatology.
