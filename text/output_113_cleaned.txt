Example 21:
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) OF THE BRAIN without contrast, dated 10/14/2022. 
INDICATION: 58-year-old female presenting with new onset of headaches and vertigo.
COMPARISON: CT scan of the brain dated 09/29/2022.
TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla unit, with sequences including FLAIR, T2* gradient echo, T1 pre and post gadolinium, amongst others, conducted sequentially.
FINDINGS: 
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or recent infarct.
2. There is a small 3 mm focus of increased FLAIR signal intensity in the right frontal lobe, likely representing a nonspecific gliotic focus.
3. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size for patientâ€™s age.
4. No significant midline shift or mass effect.
5. The orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
6. No abnormal enhancement post-contrast administration.
IMPRESSION: 
1. MRI brain findings are generally unremarkable, with no significant abnormality detected to explain patient's symptoms.
2. Small nonspecific gliotic focus in the right frontal lobe noted. Clinical correlation suggested.
3. Recommend follow-up or additional diagnostic evaluation for unexplained vertigo and headaches, as MRI findings alone do not fully account for clinical symptoms.
