Example 21:  
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 09/15/2021  
CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected heart failure due to recent history of dyspnea on exertion.  
FINDINGS:  
1. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured at 40%, indicating mild systolic dysfunction.  
2. Mild left atrial enlargement.  
3. Normal right ventricular size and function.  
4. No significant valvular abnormalities detected.  
5. No pericardial effusion.  
COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated 03/01/2019.  
IMPRESSION:  
1. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction as compared to previous measurement of 55% on 03/01/2019 suggestive of progressive systolic dysfunction.  
2. Mild left atrial enlargement likely related to left ventricular diastolic pressure increase.  
RECOMMENDATIONS:  
1. Initiate or optimize medical therapy for heart failure as clinically indicated.  
2. Consider follow-up echocardiogram in 6 months to monitor cardiac function and response to therapy.  
3. Cardiology follow-up recommended.
