Example 21:
PROSTATE MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 9/15/2023. HISTORY: 67-year-old male with rising PSA levels. COMPARISON: MRI dated 12/20/2021. IMPRESSION: 1. Prostate gland is enlarged measuring approximately 45 grams with heterogeneous signal intensity. 2. Several nodules noted within the transitional zone, the largest measuring 1.2 cm in the right lobe, suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. 3. No evidence of extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion. 4. The visualized portions of the pelvic bones are unremarkable. 5. No enlarged lymph nodes or obvious bone lesions. IMPRESSION: The findings are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia without signs of malignancy. Further clinical correlation and follow-up imaging recommended based on PSA levels and clinical symptoms.
