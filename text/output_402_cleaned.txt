Example 21:
ULTRASOUND LOWER EXTREMITY BILATERAL 3/15/2023 CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). COMPARISON: Doppler study 1/22/2023. FINDINGS: Evaluation of the common femoral, femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins bilaterally. The right lower extremity veins demonstrate normal compressibility with no evidence of thrombosis. There are no visible intraluminal defects or reflux. The left lower extremity reveals a non-compressible segment in the popliteal vein suggestive of an acute DVT. The calf veins are compressible and appear normal. Visualized arterial flow is within normal limits without evidence of stenosis. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis in left popliteal vein. 2. No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
