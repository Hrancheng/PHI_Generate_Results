Example 21:
MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 07/21/2022 at 14:45 PM. INDICATION: 52-year-old male with chronic low back pain, rule out disc herniation. COMPARISON: MRI of the lumbar spine dated 05/15/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner. Axial and sagittal images were obtained through the lumbar spine without the use of contrast material. FINDINGS: There is mild disc desiccation and disc height loss at L4-L5 and L5-S1. There is a small broad-based disc protrusion at L4-L5 which abuts but does not significantly compress the thecal sac or nerve roots. No significant neural foraminal narrowing. The conus medullaris terminates at L1 and appears normal. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1 without significant compression of neural elements. 2. Stable small broad-based disc protrusion at L4-L5 as compared to prior study.
