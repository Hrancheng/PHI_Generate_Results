Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 10/5/2020. INDICATION: 53-year-old male presenting with headaches and blurred vision. COMPARISON: MRI Brain dated 1/20/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla machine. Sequences included T1, T2, FLAIR, and DWI prior to and following administration of 15 mL of Gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are of normal size for age. There is a small 3 mm focus of increased FLAIR signal intensity in the white matter of the left frontal lobe, which could represent a small area of gliosis or demyelination. No significant post-contrast enhancement to suggest an active lesion. The major intracranial vessels show patent flow voids. No evidence of midline shift or herniation. The pituitary gland and sella turcica appear normal. The orbits and visualized sinuses are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Small area of non-specific white matter change in the left frontal lobe, likely gliosis or early demyelination. Continued clinical and imaging follow-up recommended.
