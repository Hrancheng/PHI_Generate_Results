Example 21:
MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 09/15/2021. INDICATION: 52-year-old female with chronic low back pain, rule out herniated disc. COMPARISON: MRI lumbar spine dated 03/09/2020. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-planar imaging of the lumbar spine was performed without the administration of contrast. FINDINGS: The lumbar vertebral bodies maintain normal height and alignment with no evidence of acute fracture or subluxation. The conus medullaris terminates at the L1 level and appears normal in morphology. At L4-L5, there is a broad-based disc bulge with superimposed small central disc protrusion mildly indenting the thecal sac but not significantly compressing nerve roots. No significant facet arthropathy or ligamentum flavum hypertrophy is seen. The remaining lumbar discs demonstrate mild desiccation without significant herniation. Normal signal intensity of the spinal cord and cauda equina nerves. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of significant nerve root compression. 2. Mild disc degeneration of the lumbar spine, most pronounced at L4-L5 with a small central disc protrusion. No change compared to prior MRI.
