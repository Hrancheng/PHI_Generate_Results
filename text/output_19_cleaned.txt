Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI dated 10/15/2021. 11:30 AM INDICATION: Evaluation of heart function post-myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram 8/20/2021. TECHNIQUE: 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner was utilized using a comprehensive cardiac protocol encompassing both static and dynamic imaging phases to assess cardiac structure and function. ECG-gated imaging was performed. 
FINDINGS:
1. The left ventricle demonstrates normal systolic function with an ejection fraction estimated at 55%.
2. No evidence of mural thrombus or regional wall motion abnormalities.
3. The right ventricle and both atria appear normal in size.
4. No pericardial effusions are identified.
5. Valves are morphologically normal without signs of significant valvular dysfunction.
6. No delayed enhancement patterns suggestive of fibrosis or scar tissue.
7. Aortic root and ascending aorta are within normal dimensions.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal cardiac function with no signs of dysfunction or structural anomalies post-myocardial infarction.
2. Stable cardiac profile compared to the previous echocardiogram dated 8/20/2021.
