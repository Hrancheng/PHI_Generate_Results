Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI, 9/15/2022 14:00 CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected cardiomyopathy. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram dated 6/10/2022. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed without and with the administration of gadolinium contrast, focusing on cardiac morphology and function. FINDINGS: There is mild to moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function. Ejection fraction estimated at 55%. No evident myocardial scar on late gadolinium enhancement imaging. Right ventricle is normal in size and function. Valves appear structurally normal without significant stenosis or insufficiency. No pericardial effusion or signs of constriction. Normal size, structure, and signal intensity of the atria. A small hiatal hernia is noted as an incidental finding. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild to moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic function. 2. No myocardial scar or ischemic changes on MRI. Recommendations for follow-up echocardiography in one year or if clinical symptoms change.
