Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated 10/14/2022. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for possible multiple sclerosis. HISTORY: Increasing headaches and episodic numbness over past six months. COMPARISON: MRI dated 04/05/2022.  TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla machine with multi-sequence, multi-planar imaging including T1, T2, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted, and post-contrast T1 sequences. FINDINGS: There are several foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the periventricular white matter bilaterally. The largest lesion measures approximately 8 mm in maximum diameter located adjacent to the left lateral ventricle. Following contrast administration, mild enhancement is noted in the largest lesion, suggestive of active disease. No evidence of significant mass effect or midline shift. The basal ganglia, thalami, cerebellum, and brainstem appear normal. Vascular structures appear normal with no evidence of stenosis or aneurysm. IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple periventricular white matter lesions with features suggestive of demyelinating disease, possibly multiple sclerosis. Active disease suggested by enhancement of one lesion. 2. Recommend clinical correlation and consideration for lumbar puncture and further neurologic consultation.
