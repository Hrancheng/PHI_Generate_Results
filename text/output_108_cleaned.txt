Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 9/24/2021. HISTORY: Suspected left ventricular dysfunction and history of coronary artery disease. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated 12/15/2020. TECHNIQUE: 1. Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiogram performed using state-of-the-art ultrasound equipment. FINDINGS: 1. Left ventricle: The left ventricular cavity size is mildly increased. There is moderate global hypokinesis of the left ventricle with a visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%. No wall motion abnormalities are noted beyond generalized hypokinesis. 2. Valves: Mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with mild mitral regurgitation. The aortic valve is trileaflet with mild aortic regurgitation. Tricuspid and pulmonary valves are normal with no significant regurgitation. 3. Atria: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium appears normal. 4. Pericardium: There is no evidence of pericardial effusion. 5. Doppler: Diastolic function is consistent with grade I diastolic dysfunction. No hemodynamically significant gradients across any valves. IMPRESSION: 1. Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with moderate global hypokinesis and reduced ejection fraction suggesting systolic dysfunction. 2. Mild mitral and aortic valve regurgitation. No significant valve stenosis. 3. Grade I diastolic dysfunction. Recommendations for follow-up include re-evaluation in one year with a repeat echocardiogram or sooner if clinically indicated.
