Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI DATED 09/15/2021 CLINICAL INDICATION: Assessment of ventricular function post-myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated 08/01/2021. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence MRI of the heart was performed using a 1.5 Tesla system. Delayed enhancement sequences included to assess myocardial viability. FINDINGS: The left ventricle demonstrates normal size with mild hypokinesis of the inferior wall. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. No evidence of thrombus. Delayed enhancement indicates a small area of fibrosis in the inferior myocardium, consistent with a non-transmural previous infarct. Valves appear intact with no significant regurgitation. Pulmonary veins and aorta are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable mild hypokinesis of the inferior wall of the left ventricle likely related to prior myocardial event. 2. Small area of myocardial fibrosis. No acute disease.
