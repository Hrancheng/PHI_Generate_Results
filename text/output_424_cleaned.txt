FINDINGS: There is a new 2 cm enhancing lesion on the left temporal lobe, suggestive of a primary brain tumor. No evidence of hemorrhage or significant midline shift. Remaining brain parenchyma is unremarkable with no additional abnormal enhancement. The ventricular system is within normal limits. No evidence of hydrocephalus. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New left temporal lobe lesion consistent with primary neoplasm. Further evaluation with biopsy recommended to determine pathology.
