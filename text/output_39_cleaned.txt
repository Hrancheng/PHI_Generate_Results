ULTRASOUND OF THE ABDOMEN 07/15/2022 CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for hepatosplenomegaly. COMPARISON: Previous ultrasound dated 03/03/2021. TECHNIQUE: Real-time and static imaging was performed utilizing grayscale and color Doppler. FINDINGS: The liver is enlarged measuring 19 cm in span and exhibits a homogenous echotexture. No focal liver lesions are visible. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated. The common bile duct measures 3 mm in diameter. Portal vein and hepatic veins are patent with normal doppler waveforms. The gallbladder is physiologically distended, with no stones or wall thickening. The spleen is mildly enlarged at 13 cm but maintains a normal echotexture. No splenic lesions or infarcts are noted. Kidneys are normal in size and contour with no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones. The pancreas is obscured by bowel gas but appears unremarkable in the visualized portions. Ascites is not observed. IMPRESSION: 1. Hepatomegaly without focal lesions. 2. Mild splenomegaly. Normal gallbladder and bile ducts. 3. Unremarkable examination of the kidneys and visualized portions of the pancreas. Note: Recommendation for follow-up imaging in 6 months to monitor spleen size and liver parameters.
