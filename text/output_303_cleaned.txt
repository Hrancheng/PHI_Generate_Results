Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 10/5/2020. HISTORY: 72-year-old female with new-onset seizures and memory loss. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated 8/20/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed using a high-resolution 3 Tesla system with diffusion-weighted imaging, FLAIR, and T1 and T2 sequences both with and without gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There is mild generalized cerebral atrophy appropriate for age. No evidence of acute ischemic changes. Multiple small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. No mass effect, midline shift, or abnormal enhancement post-contrast. The ventricles and sulci are normally configured. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of an acute intracranial process. 2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes. 3. Stable mild cerebral atrophy when compared to prior studies. 4. No new abnormalities noted since the last MRI.
