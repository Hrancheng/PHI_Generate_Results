MRA BRAIN AND NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated 10/05/2021 14:45 PM INDICATION: 63-year-old female with history of transient ischemic attacks. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated 07/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence multi-planar MRI of the brain and MRA of the neck were conducted using a 3 Tesla machine. Post-contrast imaging performed uneventfully with 20 mL Gadovist injected IV. FINDINGS: Brain: No acute infarct or mass effect is noted. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes are apparent. Mild atrophy for age. Bilateral hippocampi are unremarkable without any significant signal abnormality. Neck: No significant stenosis or occlusion identified in the carotid or vertebral arteries. Normal flow voids in the major dural sinuses. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute or recent infarct. 2. No high-grade stenosis or occlusion in the neck vessels. Normal vascular anatomy with expected flow for age. 3. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes, typical for patientâ€™s age.
