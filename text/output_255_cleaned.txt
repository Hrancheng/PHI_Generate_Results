Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 10/5/2022. CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected multiple sclerosis. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated 8/10/2021. TECHNIQUE: The study was performed using a 3 Tesla magnet with sequences in multiple planes. An uneventful administration of 15 mL of Gadolinium-based contrast was noted. FINDINGS: There are several small white matter lesions consistent with demyelinating plaques, primarily located in the periventricular region. The largest lesion measures 10 mm. There is no evidence of mass effect or midline shift. Enhanced sequences post-contrast did not reveal significant enhancement, suggesting no active disease progression. The brainstem and cerebellum are unremarked for their appearances. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple white matter lesions likely represent demyelinating plaques indicative of multiple sclerosis. 2. No evidence of active disease progression at this time. 3. Recommend follow-up MRI in one year or sooner if clinically indicated.
