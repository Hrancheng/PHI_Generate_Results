Example 21:
ECHO DOPPLER OF THE ABDOMEN dated 9/14/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: 58-year-old male with history of liver cirrhosis. COMPARISON: Previous abdominal ultrasound dated 6/5/2019. TECHNIQUE: Using a 3.5 MHz curvilinear transducer, scans were performed in longitudinal and transverse planes. FINDINGS: The liver appears enlarged, measuring 18 cm in span, and echoes are coarsely increased, suggestive of chronic liver disease and fibrosis. No discrete focal lesions are identified. Portal vein is patent with anterograde flow and normal calibre. The spleen is mildly enlarged, measuring 14 cm. No ascites or pleural effusion is evident. The gallbladder is normal in size and wall thickness, with no evidence of cholelithiasis. The common bile duct measures 3 mm, within normal limits. Kidneys are normal in size and echotexture with no hydronephrosis. PANCREAS: The pancreas is visualized and normal in echotexture. No pancreatic ductal dilation. IMPRESSION: Echographic features suggestive of cirrhosis. Spleen size mildly increased, but no evidence of significant portal hypertension (such as ascites). Regular follow up suggested for further monitoring of liver function.
