Example 21:
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 10/24/2019
CLINICAL INDICATION: Headache, rule out mass.
COMPARISON: CT head 9/1/2019
TECHNIQUE: Multiparametric MRI performed with diffusion, perfusion, and spectroscopy, both with and without 15 mL Gadavist.
FINDINGS: 
- The MRI reveals a well-circumscribed lesion measuring 2 cm x 3 cm in the right frontal lobe which is hyperintense on T2 and hypointense on T1. 
- No significant edema or mass effect is observed. 
- No midline shift. 
- The ventricular system is normal and basal cisterns are preserved.
- Spectroscopy shows increased Cho/Cr ratio indicative of high cellular activity. 
- Perfusion imaging reveals elevated rCBV within the lesion consistent with a high-grade glioma.
- No evidence of additional intra or extra-axial lesions.
IMPRESSSION:
1. New right frontal lobe lesion consistent with high-grade glioma.
2. No evidence of metastatic disease or additional intracranial pathology.
3. Neurosurgical consultation recommended for possible biopsy.
