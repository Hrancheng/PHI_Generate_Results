Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, dated 10/25/2020. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for suspected demyelinating disease. 52-year-old female with a history of visual disturbances and ataxia. COMPARISON: MRI brain 09/10/2020. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging of the brain was performed without and with the administration of 15 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast. The study included diffusion-weighted, FLAIR, T1, and T2 sequences. FINDINGS: There are numerous foci of high T2 signal within the periventricular and subcortical white matter. No evidence of restricted diffusion. Enhanced imaging demonstrated several enhancing lesions, predominantly involving the periventricular white matter. The largest lesion measured approximately 1.2 cm within the right frontal periventricular area. The basal ganglia and thalami appear normal. No significant midline shift. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration. The cerebellum, brainstem, and cranial nerves appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple white matter lesions with some showing contrast enhancement, consistent with active demyelination, suggesting multiple sclerosis or another demyelinating process. Follow-up and further evaluation with a neurologist are recommended.
