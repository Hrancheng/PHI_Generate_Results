Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 07/25/2022. INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected myocarditis. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram dated 05/30/2022. TECHNIQUE: Dynamic imaging post-gadolinium administration using the St. Helena Heart Center cardiac protocol. Additional acquisitions with T2-weighted and delayed enhancement sequences. FINDINGS: The left ventricular chamber size is within normal limits with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%. There is mild hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall. Late gadolinium enhancement images demonstrate subepicardial enhancement consistent with myocarditis predominantly affecting the lateral wall of the left ventricle. The right ventricle is unremarkable with normal wall motion and thickness. Valves appear grossly intact without significant regurgitation or stenosis. No evidence of pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: 1. Imaging findings suggestive of myocarditis, likely viral etiology. 2. Normal right ventricular size and function. 3. Mild left ventricular hypokinesis but preserved ejection fraction. Recommendations: Follow-up with MRI in 3 months to reassess myocardial changes and recovery. Concurrent clinical review recommended to manage symptoms and possible etiologic factors.
