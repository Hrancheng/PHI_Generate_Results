Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 09/15/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for multiple sclerosis. COMPARISON: MRI from 05/10/2021. TECHNIQUE: Multi-planar, multi-sequence MRI of the brain was performed with and without the administration of 15 mL of Gadavist® IV contrast. FINDINGS: New periventricular demyelinating plaques are noted compared to prior study. These plaques show enhancement post-contrast, suggesting active disease. Several old, non-enhancing lesions consistent with known multiple sclerosis plaques are also seen. No evidence of mass effect, midline shift, or acute hemorrhage. Ventricles and sulci are within normal limits for patient’s age. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple new enhancing lesions indicative of active multiple sclerosis. 2. Stable appearance of older, non-active lesions. Continued follow-up with neurology recommended for management adjustments.
