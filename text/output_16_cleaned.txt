Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 7/28/2021. INDICATION: 58-year-old female with progressive memory loss and suspected dementia. COMPARISON: MRI brain 7/15/2019. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla machine, using standard dementia protocol. Images obtained pre and post the administration of 15mL Gadovist. FINDINGS: There is cortical thinning noted predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes. No significant white matter hyperintensities or evidence of acute ischemia. The ventricular system is symmetric without shift. Hippocampal volumes are significantly reduced bilaterally, consistent with hippocampal atrophy. No midline shift or significant mass effect is observed. Cerebellum appears within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Bilateral hippocampal atrophy notable, likely correlating with patientâ€™s clinical presentation of memory impairment. 2. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
