MR ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 04/28/2021 10:30 AM INDICATION: 52-year-old female with history of chronic liver disease and suspected hepatocellular carcinoma. COMPARISON: MRI dated 01/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: MRI is performed using a 3 Tesla machine, encompassing detailed sequences to visualize liver architecture and potential lesions. Dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences were performed after the uneventful administration of 20 mL of Multihance. FINDINGS: There is heterogeneous enhancement of the liver consistent with cirrhotic changes. A 2.5 cm lesion in segment VIII of the liver demonstrates arterial phase hyperenhancement and washout in the portal venous phase, suggesting hepatocellular carcinoma. No other focal liver lesions are seen. There is no evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The spleen is mildly enlarged, measuring 13 cm in length without focal lesions. The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear normal. Ascites is present. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Imaging features suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma in a cirrhotic liver. 2. Mild splenomegaly and ascites related to portal hypertension.
