Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 04/07/2021 10:30 AM. INDICATION: 58-year-old male with history of chronic headaches and recent onset of dizziness. COMPARISON: MRI dated 03/01/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed using a 3 Tesla scanner following the Bethesda Neurological Institute chronic headache protocol. Images obtained before and following administration of 15 mL Gadovist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: No significant interval change since the last MRI. There is a stable small hyperintense focus in the right frontal white matter, consistent with a nonspecific small vessel ischemic change. No mass, shift, or acute infarction. No evidence of abnormal enhancement to suggest malignancy. Venous and arterial flow voids appear normal. The ventricles and sulci are normal in configuration and size for age. INCIDENTAL FINDING: Mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses, likely inflammatory. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged small vessel ischemic change in the right frontal white matter. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Recommend follow-up per clinical symptoms; neurology consultation might be beneficial.
