TECHNIQUE: Multi-planar, multi-sequence MRI of the brain was performed without and then with 15 mL of Gadavist contrast. No incidents.
FINDINGS: 
There are several new periventricular white matter lesions, highly suggestive of active demyelination, which are new compared to the previous MRI dated 03/15/2020. There is no evidence of mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The major intracranial vessels demonstrate normal flow voids. No acute hemorrhage or extra-axial collection is noted. 
IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New demyelinating lesions indicative of potentially active multiple sclerosis. 2. No signs of acute ischemia or hemorrhage.
