Intervertebral discs from C2-C3 through C7-T1 show no significant disc herniation or neural compression. The vertebral bodies maintain normal height with preserved alignment. No significant spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable postsurgical changes at C4-C5 with no evidence of hardware complication. 2. No acute disc herniation or significant neural impingement. 3. Recommend follow-up as clinically indicated, possibly including physical therapy for ongoing symptoms.
