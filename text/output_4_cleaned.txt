Example 21:
EXAM: MRI BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, dated 04/15/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluate for possible demyelinating disease. COMPARISON: MRI Brain dated 02/20/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed using a Cleveland Clinic standard brain protocol without and with 15 mL of Gadolinium. FINDINGS: There are several new periventricular white matter lesions as compared to the previous MRI. These lesions show increased signal on FLAIR and T2-weighted images and enhance post contrast. No evidence of significant mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are within normal limits for the patient's age. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New demyelinating lesions suggestive of active disease. Recommendations for clinical correlation and consultation with neurology for possible therapy modification.
