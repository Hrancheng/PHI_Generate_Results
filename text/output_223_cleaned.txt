ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: 6/25/2023 HISTORY: Pain and swelling in the abdomen, rule out appendicitis. COMPARISON: Ultrasound 4/18/2022. FINDINGS: The liver is normal in size and echotexture without evidence of focal lesions. Bile ducts are not dilated, measuring within normal limits. The gallbladder is normal in appearance without stones or wall thickening; no pericholecystic fluid noted. The pancreas is homogeneous in echogenicity and normal in size. No evidence of pancreatic duct dilatation. The spleen is unremarkable, measuring 10 cm. No free fluid is observed in the abdomen. The appendix is not visualized, suggesting a non-inflamed state; however, clinical correlation is recommended due to the patient's symptoms. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal hepatobiliary and pancreatic evaluation. 2. Non-visualization of the appendix, correlation with clinical symptoms and further evaluation if symptoms persist.
