Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 07/22/2021. INDICATION: Evaluation for myocardial fibrosis. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated 01/15/2019. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed using a 3 Tesla scanner with specific cardiac sequences per Heart Health Institute MRI protocol. FINDINGS: The left ventricular function is within normal limits with an estimated ejection fraction of 55%. There is no evidence of segmental wall motion abnormalities. Late gadolinium enhancement demonstrates a small, non-ischemic pattern of enhancement in the basal segments suggesting possible myocardial fibrosis. Right ventricular size and function are normal. Valves appear structurally normal without significant stenosis or regurgitation. PERICARDIUM: No evidence of thickening or pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable cardiac structure and function compared to previous imaging. 2. Small area of late gadolinium enhancement in the basal segments, consistent with non-ischemic myocardial fibrosis. Follow up as clinically indicated.
