Example 21:
MRI SPINE CERVICAL WITHOUT CONTRAST dated 09/15/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: 54-year-old male with chronic neck pain and radiculopathy. COMPARISON: MRI cervical spine 03/10/2019. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the cervical spine was performed without the use of intravenous contrast. Axial and sagittal planes were obtained using T1, T2, and STIR sequences. FINDINGS: There is evidence of multilevel degenerative disc disease most prominent at C5-C6 where there is a small central disc protrusion causing mild indentation on the ventral aspect of the thecal sac. No significant neural foraminal narrowing is observed. The cervical spinal cord exhibits normal signal intensity with no evidence of cord edema or compression. The vertebral body heights are maintained with no evidence of compression fractures. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multilevel degenerative changes without significant neural compression. 2. Small central disc protrusion at C5-C6 without significant impingement. Recommends continuation of conservative management including physical therapy and follow-up as clinically indicated.
