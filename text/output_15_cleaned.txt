Example 21:
MRI PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 7/18/2021 10:30 AM INDICATION: 52-year-old female with history of chronic pelvic pain, rule out endometriosis. COMPARISON: Pelvic ultrasound dated 5/22/2021. TECHNIQUE: Dynamic pelvic MRI was performed using a multisequence, multiplanar approach both with and without intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: The uterus is normal in size and contour with a homogenous myometrium. There is no evidence of leiomyoma or adenomyosis. The endometrial stripe measures 5 mm, which is appropriate for the patient's menopausal status. Ovaries are not enlarged, and no significant adnexal masses are identified. Mild bilateral pelvic free fluid is seen, which is non-specific but could be physiologic. No significant lymphadenopathy is identified. IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of deep infiltrating endometriosis or significant pelvic pathology.
2. Mild nonspecific pelvic free fluid, likely physiologic.
