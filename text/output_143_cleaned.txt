ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT, dated 09/15/2022 
INDICATION: Evaluation of murmurs and shortness of breath. 
TECHNIQUE: Transthoracic echocardiogram performed using the City Hospital Heart Center protocol with Spectral and Color Doppler, 2D and 3D imaging.
FINDINGS: 
1. Left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 55%, indicating normal systolic function.
2. No significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis observed. Mild tricuspid regurgitation noted which is physiologically normal.
3. Normal chamber sizes and wall thickness.
4. No evidence of intracardiac shunt on bubble study.
5. Aortic root dimensions are within normal limits.
6. ICU monitoring station conducted consecutive heart rate monitoring revealing normal sinus rhythm throughout the recording.
IMPRESSSION:
1. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
2. No evidence of significant valvular disease. Mild tricuspid regurgitation likely physiologic.
CONCLUSION:
The echocardiographic study reveals a structurally normal heart with normal systolic function and no significant hemodynamically valvular disease. Follow-up in clinical cardiology clinic recommended in one year, or sooner if symptoms increase.
