Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST 9/15/2022 CLINICAL INDICATION: Chronic back pain with suspected lumbar disc herniation. HISTORY: Lower back pain persisting for several months, worsening with physical activity. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated 4/5/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner without the use of contrast. The study includes sagittal T1, T2, and axial T2-weighted images of the lumbar spine.
FINDINGS: 
- The lumbar vertebral bodies maintain normal height and alignment with no evidence of acute fracture.
- L3-L4 intervertebral disc shows mild disc bulge without significant central canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
- L4-L5 disc exhibits moderate disc bulge with superimposed broad-based left paracentral disc protrusion. This protrusion contacts the traversing left L5 nerve root but does not cause significant displacement.
- Surrounding soft tissue structures are intact and unremarkable. 
- Sacroiliac joints and visualized portions of the pelvis appear normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate disc bulge at L4-L5 with a left paracentral disc protrusion contacting the left L5 nerve root. Correlate with patient symptoms and consider clinical management based on pain and mobility assessment.
2. Stable mild disc bulge at L3-L4 without significant neural compression compared to prior study from 4/5/2020.
