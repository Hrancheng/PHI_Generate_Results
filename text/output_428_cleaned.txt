Example 21:
EXAM: MRI SPINE, LUMBAR DATED 09/15/2021. 
CLINICAL INDICATION: Lower back pain with radiation to lower limbs. HISTORY OF DISC DEGENERATION.
COMPARISON: MRI dated 03/21/2019. 
TECHNIQUE: MRI Lumbar spine was performed with and without contrast on a 3 Tesla machine, following standard institutional protocol.
FINDINGS: 
1. L4-L5: Moderate disc bulging with a broad-based central disc protrusion contacting the thecal sac but not causing significant spinal stenosis. No nerve root impingement observed.
2. L5-S1: Mild disc bulge without disc herniation. No spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. Sacral roots appear intact.
3. Vertebral body heights and alignments are maintained with no evidence of acute fracture. Normal marrow signal is retained.
4. Conus medullaris terminates at the appropriate level, with no abnormal signal intensity.
5. Soft tissues surrounding the spine are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Disc protrusion at L4-L5 without significant spinal canal stenosis or nerve root compression.
2. No progressive degenerative changes when compared to 03/21/2019.
3. Recommended follow-up in 1 year or sooner if symptoms worsen.
