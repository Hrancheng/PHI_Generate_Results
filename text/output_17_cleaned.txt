Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 9/15/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: Heart murmur evaluation. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Comprehensive 2D echocardiogram with Doppler and color flow imaging performed. FINDINGS: The left ventricle is normal in size with preserved systolic function, estimated EF of 55%. No wall motion abnormalities noted. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium appears normal. Mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with mild regurgitation. Aortic valve is trileaflet and demonstrates mild sclerosis without significant stenosis; mild aortic regurgitation is noted. Tricuspid and pulmonary valves appear unremarkable. There are no signs of intracardiac thrombus or pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: 1. Normal left and right ventricular size and function. 2. Mild mitral and aortic regurgitation with valve leaflet thickening and sclerosis respectively. Mild left atrial enlargement. 3. No evidence of intracardiac thrombus or pericardial effusion.
