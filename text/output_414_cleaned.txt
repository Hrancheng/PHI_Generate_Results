Example 21:
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) REPORT dated 12/10/2021 CLINICAL INDICATION: Palpitations and pre-syncope episodes. COMPARISON: ECG from 10/23/2019. FINDINGS: The ECG demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 72 beats per minute, with no significant ST-segment changes or T-wave abnormalities. There is no evidence of any acute ischemic changes. Interval comparison shows mild reduction in PR interval, previously noted at 160 ms now measuring 140 ms, which may suggest an evolving atrioventricular conduction pattern but remains within the normal range. No atrial enlargement or ventricular hypertrophy. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Normal sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes. 2. Mild change in PR interval noted; continue monitoring and clinical correlation recommended.
