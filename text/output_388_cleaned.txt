Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated 10/15/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: New-onset seizures. COMPARISON: CT of the head dated 09/28/2021. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla machine focusing on detailed brain anatomy with and without the administration of 15 mL Gadavist contrast. IMAGES: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging of the brain was performed. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There is a 2 mm focus of increased FLAIR signal intensity in the white matter of the left frontal lobe, which could represent a small area of gliosis or demyelination. No significant midline shift. The basal ganglia, thalami, brainstem, and cerebellum are unremarkable. There is no abnormal enhancement post-contrast administration. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology. 2. Small focus of non-specific white matter signal abnormality in the left frontal lobe, likely gliotic; follow-up or further evaluation with MRA could be considered if clinically warranted.
