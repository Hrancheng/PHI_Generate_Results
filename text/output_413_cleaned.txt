Example 21:
EXAM: CERVICAL SPINE MRI 9/15/2022. CLINICAL INDICATION: Persistent neck pain following motor vehicle accident. COMPARISON: Previous cervical spine MRI dated 5/10/2021. TECHNIQUE: MRI cervical spine was performed utilizing multi-planar, multi-sequence imaging without the use of contrast. FINDINGS: The cervical vertebrae demonstrate normal alignment with no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. Discs from C2-C7 are intact with no significant disc herniation or neural foraminal narrowing. There is mild diffuse disc bulge at C4-C5 level but no significant impingement on the spinal cord or nerve roots. Marrow signal within visualized portions of the cervical vertebrae is homogeneous and within normal limits for 45-year-old patient. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute cervical spine injury. 2. Mild diffuse disc bulge at C4-C5 without significant neural impingement. Continued outpatient follow-up and physical therapy recommended.
