Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI 4/14/2022 TIME: 2:30 PM INDICATION: Suspicion of cardiac sarcoidosis. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram 2/20/2022. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed using both T1 and T2 sequences. Late gadolinium enhancement imaging was performed to assess for myocardial fibrosis or scarring indicative of sarcoid or other myocardial disease.
FINDINGS:
1. Myocardial: Patchy areas of delayed hyperenhancement in the basal septum and lateral wall of the left ventricle suggesting non-ischemic myocardial damage, possibly sarcoidosis.
2. Ventricles: Left ventricular systolic function is within normal limits with an ejection fraction of 55%. Right ventricular size and function are also normal.
3. Valves: Aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonary valves appear normal with no significant regurgitation.
4. Pericardium: No pericardial effusion or thickening noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings suggestive of cardiac sarcoidosis given the patchy pattern of late gadolinium enhancement.
2. Normal left and right ventricular size and function.
3. No valvular or pericardial abnormalities detected.
Follow-up recommendations include clinical correlation with serum markers and potential initiation of corticosteroid therapy depending on clinical symptoms and lab results. Further FDG-PET scanning may be considered to assess for active inflammation.
