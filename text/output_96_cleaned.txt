Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 10/15/2022 2:30 PM. INDICATION: 58-year-old female with new-onset seizures. COMPARISON: CT brain from 09/28/2022. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla machine. Sequences included T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, and post-contrast T1. FINDINGS: The MRI reveals no acute infarct. There is a 2 cm enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe, suggestive of a primary brain tumor vs metastatic disease. Perfusion imaging shows increased cerebral blood volume within the lesion. There are no signs of significant mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are appropriately aged without evidence of hydrocephalus. Other brain structures including the cerebellum, brainstem, and basal ganglia are unremarkable. The visualized portions of the orbits and paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. New 2 cm right temporal lobe lesion as described, differential includes primary brain tumor vs metastasis. Further evaluation with biopsy and additional imaging recommended. 2. No acute infarct or significant mass effect.
