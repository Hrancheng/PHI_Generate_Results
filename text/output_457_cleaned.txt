Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI dated 9/9/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected myocarditis. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated 7/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed using Heart Imaging Technologies protocols with gadolinium contrast enhancement. 
FINDINGS: 
1. Myocardial edema is noted in the basal segments of the lateral wall, consistent with acute myocarditis.
2. Normal left ventricular systolic function with ejection fraction estimated at 60%.
3. No evidence of myocardial fibrosis or scarring on late gadolinium enhancement imaging.
4. Right ventricular size and function are within normal limits.
5. No pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: 
1. Imaging findings are suggestive of acute myocarditis with preserved systolic function.
2. No evidence of chronic myocardial damage or pericardial disease.
3. Recommend clinical correlation and follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess for resolution or progression of inflammation.
