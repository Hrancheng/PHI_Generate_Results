Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated 5/14/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected myocarditis. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the heart performed using gadolinium-based contrast with detailed examination of cardiac structures and function. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram dated 4/13/2021. FINDINGS: Normal left ventricular size and systolic function with an ejection fraction estimated at 60%. No evidence of myocardial scarring or fibrosis on late gadolinium enhancement sequences. Mild right ventricular dilatation observed, but without impaired systolic function. No significant valvular abnormalities noted. The pericardium appears normal without signs of inflammation or effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal cardiac structure and function without evidence of myocarditis or scarring. Mild enlargement of the right ventricle, likely physiological. Continued clinical follow-up recommended.
