MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 10/14/2020. INDICATION: 53-year-old female with worsening headaches and blurred vision. COMPARISON: MRI dated 9/05/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner employing standard brain protocols. Post-contrast T1-weighted images obtained following the uneventful administration of 20 mL Gadavist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift. There are several nonspecific white matter hyperintensities on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, likely related to chronic microvascular ischemic changes. No new areas of abnormal enhancement observed compared to the previous scan. The pituitary gland, ventricles, and cerebellum appear within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable white matter changes consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia. 2. No new lesion or significant interval change since last MRI. Follow-up as clinically indicated.
