Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN W/O CONTRAST dated 9/14/2023 CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected multiple sclerosis. COMPARISON: MRI dated 9/5/2022. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging without the use of gadolinium contrast agent was performed. FINDINGS: There are several new T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the periventricular white matter bilaterally, suggesting disease progression. No significant mass effect or midline shift is noted. The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New demyelinating lesions concerning for progression of suspected multiple sclerosis. Further follow-up and possibly contrast-enhanced studies are suggested to monitor disease progression and rule out other potential etiologies.
