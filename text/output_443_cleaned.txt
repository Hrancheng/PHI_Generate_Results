Example 21:  
CHEST X-RAY 10/15/2021 CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluate for potential pneumonia. COMPARISON: Chest x-ray from 9/28/2021 and 10/1/2021.  
IMPRESSION:  
1. The lungs are moderately hyperexpanded. There are diffuse bilateral interstitial and peribronchial thickening more pronounced in the right lung compared to the left.  
2. No acute focal consolidations to suggest active pneumonia. However, the chronic changes are likely related to the patient's known COPD.  
3. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
4. The heart size is within normal limits for age and body habitus.  
5. Stable mediastinal and hilar contours with no new lymphadenopathy.  
6. Comparison with previous studies indicates no significant progression.  
Routine clinical follow-up and management in accordance with established COPD guidelines are recommended. Continued monitoring for symptoms of infection given chronic lung changes. If symptoms worsen, further imaging such as a CT scan may be considered.
