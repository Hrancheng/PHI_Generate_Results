MRI SPINE LUMBAR WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 10/15/2022 10:30 AM INDICATION: 55-year-old female with chronic lower back pain and new onset radiculopathy. COMPARISON: MRI lumbar spine dated 3/20/2019. TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial T1, T2, and STIR sequences were performed with and without Gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: There is moderate degenerative disc disease at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with associated disc bulging. The L4-L5 disc bulge impinges on the exiting right L4 nerve root. Mild facet arthropathy is also noted at these levels. No significant central canal stenosis is observed. The conus medullaris terminates at L1 without abnormal signal. Post-contrast images show no evidence of discitis or epidural abscess. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with disc bulging affecting the right L4 nerve root. 2. No evidence of discitis or significant central stenosis.
