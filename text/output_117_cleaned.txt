Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 9/14/2019. INDICATION: Evaluation of chest pain and dyspnea. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Normal left ventricular size with preserved systolic function, estimated ejection fraction of 55-60%. No wall motion abnormalities noted. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. The atria are both normal in size. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but mitral inflow is normal without significant stenosis or regurgitation. Tricuspid valve has normal movement with no significant regurgitation. The pulmonary valve is unremarkable. Aortic valve is trileaflet and shows no significant stenosis; however, mild aortic regurgitation is noted. No evidence of pericardial effusion. All chambers are normal size and function. The aorta is normal in size. Doppler measurements are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal left ventricular function and normal chamber sizes. 2. Mild aortic regurgitation. No significant valvular disease. 3. No evidence of pericardial effusion.
