Example 21:
PROCEDURE: ECHO DOPPLER HEART 5/23/2022 CLINICAL INDICATION: Heart murmur noted. Assess cardiac function. COMPARISON: Previous ECHO on 11/18/2020. FINDINGS: Left ventricular size and wall thickness are normal with preserved left ventricular systolic function; estimated ejection fraction is 55%. No regional wall motion abnormalities. Right ventricle is normal in size and function. No evidence of pericardial effusion. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Aortic root dimensions are within normal limits. Aortic valve is trileaflet without significant stenosis or regurgitation. Mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened but there is no significant mitral stenosis or regurgitation. Pulmonary pressures are estimated to be normal. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Normal cardiac structure and function with mild tricuspid regurgitation. 2. No evidence of significant valve disease.
