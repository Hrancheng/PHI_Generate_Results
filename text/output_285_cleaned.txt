Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI SPINE CERVICAL WITH CONTRAST 10/29/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: Persistent neck pain and radiculopathy post-accident. COMPARISON: MRI dated 9/15/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla, using the standard cervical spine protocol detailed to assess neural foramina and spinal cord integrity. Gadolinium contrast was administered via IV without complication, dosage of 10 mL. FINDINGS: Vertebral alignment is maintained with normal cervical lordosis. Margins of the cervical vertebrae demonstrate no signs of acute fracture. Disc spaces are preserved with no significant disc desiccation or bulging noted. No paravertebral soft tissue abnormalities are detected. The spinal canal is patent without evidence of stenosis or significant neural compression. The cervical nerve roots exit without encroachment. Minimal left-sided foraminal narrowing at C5-C6 due to mild osteophytic changes. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute cervical spine injury on todayâ€™s study. 2. Mild progressive left-sided foraminal narrowing at C5-C6, likely degenerative in nature compared to prior imaging. 3. Persistent symptoms may be neuropathic; recommend follow up with pain management specialist.
