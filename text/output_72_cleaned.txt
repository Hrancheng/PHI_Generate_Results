PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN AND PITUITARY WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 9/14/2022 INDICATION: 55-year-old male with headaches and visual disturbances. COMPARISON: MRI dated 7/20/2021. TECHNIQUE: High-resolution MRI scanning was performed on a 3T scanner. Images were obtained with and without the administration of 15 mL of Gadavist contrast medium. FINDINGS: The pituitary gland is normal in size with no evidence of macroadenoma. There is no elevation of the optic chiasm. The cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, and cerebellum appear normal without evidence of mass effect, midline shift, or abnormal enhancement. Ventricles and sulci are within normal limits. No acute infarct or hemorrhage is noted. Sellar and parasellar regions are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pituitary adenoma or other sellar pathology. 2. No significant change from previous MRI. Recommendations: Follow-up with endocrinology to correlate with endocrine function tests, subsequently annually unless symptoms increase.
