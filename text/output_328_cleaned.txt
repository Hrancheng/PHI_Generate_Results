Example 21:
THORACIC SPINE MRI 10/14/2021 TIME: 14:30 PM CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of chronic back pain with suspected disc herniation. COMPARISON: Previous spine X-ray 03/29/2021. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the thoracic spine was performed using a phased-array spine coil on a 1.5 Tesla system. Sagittal T1, T2, STIR, and axial T2-weighted images were obtained through the thoracic spine. FINDINGS: There is evidence of a moderate-sized central disc herniation at T8-T9, which is indenting the ventral aspect of the thoracic cord without significant compression. No abnormal signal within the spinal cord. The vertebral bodies maintain normal height with no evidence of fracture. The paravertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. No evidence of cord edema or myelopathy. Other intervertebral discs show mild degenerative changes without significant protrusion. IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate T8-T9 disc herniation without significant cord compromise. 2. Mild degenerative changes at other thoracic levels.
