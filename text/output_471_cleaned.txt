Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 3/15/2022. INDICATION: 59-year-old male with suspected myocardial sarcoidosis. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed with 0.2 mmol/kg Gadobutrol. Phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequences utilized for delayed enhancement. FINDINGS: There is patchy mid-myocardial enhancement in the basal to mid inferolateral wall consistent with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, possibly sarcoidosis. Myocardial thinning and fatty infiltration are noted in these segments. Left ventricular ejection fraction is approximately 45%. No evidence of myocardial rupture. Ventricular sizes are within normal limits. Mild pericardial effusion is noted. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Features consistent with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, likely secondary to sarcoidosis, as evidenced by delayed enhancement pattern and wall thinning. 2. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction to 45%. Mild pericardial effusion present. Further evaluation with PET scanning and endomyocardial biopsy may be considered for definitive diagnosis.
