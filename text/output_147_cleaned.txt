Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 11/25/2022 10:30 AM INDICATION: 53-year-old male with recurrent headaches and history of meningioma. COMPARISON: MRI dated 8/19/2020. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the brain was performed with and without gadolinium contrast on a Siemens 3T Skyra scanner. FINDINGS: The previously noted right frontal meningioma measures approximately 2.1 x 1.9 x 2.0 cm, slightly increased in size from prior measurement of 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.9 cm in 2020. The lesion shows homogeneous enhancement without evidence of new cystic changes or hemorrhage. Mild surrounding vasogenic edema is slightly more pronounced than on the previous examination. There are no additional intra or extra-axial masses. The ventricles and sulci are of normal size. No midline shift. The skull base and cranial vault show no destructive changes. The major intracranial vessels demonstrate normal flow voids on T2 sequences. No acute infarction or areas of restricted diffusion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Slight progression in the size of the known right frontal meningioma. 2. Stable mild vasogenic edema. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
