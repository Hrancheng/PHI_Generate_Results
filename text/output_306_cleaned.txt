Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 10/4/2022 14:00 PM INDICATION: 52-year-old female with new-onset seizures. COMPARISON: CT brain dated 09/28/2022. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla machine, utilizing Metropolitan Neuroimaging Center's standard seizure protocol. Coils used for signal enhancement and multiple sequences including T1, T2, FLAIR, and Diffusion-Weighted Imaging were performed. FINDINGS: The MRI scan showed no significant mass effect or midline shift. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or large vessel occlusion. There is a focal area of increased T2/FLAIR signal intensity in the left temporal lobe consistent with gliosis or low-grade glioma. The hippocampal formations are symmetric with no signs of sclerosis. The ventricular system is age-appropriate without significant dilatation. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Chronic changes in the left temporal lobe likely representing gliosis or a low-grade neoplasm. Further evaluation with follow-up MRI and possible biopsy could be considered to clarify the nature of the lesion.
