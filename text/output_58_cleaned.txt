ECHO CARDIOGRAM REPORT, 9/15/2022 at 14:00 PM CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected heart failure. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram performed on 06/12/2022. TECHNIQUE: Use of a 3.5 MHz transducer for adequate imaging. FINDINGS: The left ventricle shows normal size with preserved systolic function, EF estimated at 60%. Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy is observed. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. There is mild mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation. The aortic valve is trileaflet and displays mild aortic stenosis. No pericardial effusion is identified. The pulmonary artery pressures are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Preserved left ventricular systolic function. 2. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy. 3. Only mild valve abnormalities without significant hemodynamic consequence.
