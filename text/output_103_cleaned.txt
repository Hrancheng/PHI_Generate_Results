Example 21:
MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST 09/18/2022 INDICATION: Chronic low back pain with suspected lumbar radiculopathy. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated 03/03/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the lumbar spine was performed without the use of contrast on a 1.5 Tesla machine. AXIAL and SAGITTAL T2 and T1 sequences were obtained to assess disc integrity and nerve root impingement. FINDINGS: There is mild disc degeneration at L4-L5 level with a small posterior disc bulge. The disc bulge is not impinging on the thecal sac or exiting nerve roots. There are no signs of significant stenosis. Facet joints at L3-L4 and L5-S1 show mild arthritic changes with no significant foraminal narrowing. The conus medullaris terminates at the appropriate level and appears normal in signal intensity. The visualized paraspinal muscles are intact with no abnormal signal. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild disc degeneration at L4-L5 with small non-impinging posterior disc bulge. 2. Mild facet arthrosis at L3-L4 and L5-S1. No evidence of lumbar radiculopathy or significant spinal canal stenosis.
