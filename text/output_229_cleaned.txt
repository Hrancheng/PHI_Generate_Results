TECHNIQUE: 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging without the use of contrast material was performed. FINDINGS: There are no acute intracranial abnormalities. The brain parenchyma demonstrates normal signal intensity without evidence of mass effect, midline shift, or abnormal enhancement. Ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There are no signs of acute hemorrhage or recent infarct. The major intracranial vessels appear patent. Cerebellum appears normal. Visualized orbits, paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells and skull base structures are normal. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial abnormalities observed. 2. Stable compared to the previous CT head from 7/02/2021. Normal MRI findings consistent with the history of recurrent migraines.
