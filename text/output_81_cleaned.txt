Example 21:
CHEST X-RAY 3/25/2022 10:30 AM INDICATION: Evaluation for suspected pneumonia. COMPARISON: Previous chest x-ray dated 1/15/2022. TECHNIQUE: Standard posteroanterior and lateral views obtained. FINDINGS: There is mild interstitial thickening, predominantly in the lower lobes, which could be consistent with early infectious changes. No pleural effusion or significant consolidation noted. Heart size is within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. No definitive evidence of pneumonia is observed, although mild interstitial thickening suggestive of early infectious process cannot be ruled out. 2. Comparison with prior studies recommended to assess progression. Mild cardiomegaly may merit clinical correlation.
