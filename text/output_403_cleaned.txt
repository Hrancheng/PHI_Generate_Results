COMPARISON: Ultrasound abdomen from 05/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: A comprehensive ultrasound of the abdomen was performed including Doppler studies of the hepatic vasculature. FINDINGS: The liver is enlarged measuring 18 cm in span and demonstrates increased echogenicity suggestive of fatty infiltration. No discrete hepatic masses or lesions are visible. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated. The common bile duct measures 3 mm in diameter. Normal flow is demonstrated in the portal vein and hepatic arteries. The gallbladder is visualized without evidence of stones or wall thickening; however, sludge is noted. The pancreas is unremarkable with no masses or ductal dilatation. Both kidneys are normal in size with clear differentiation of cortex and medulla. No renal masses or hydronephrosis. The spleen is normal in size and echotexture. No free fluid is noted in the abdomen. Aorta is normal in calibre with no aneurysm. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Hepatomegaly with fatty infiltration of the liver. 2. Gallbladder sludge without cholecystitis. 3. Otherwise normal abdominal ultrasound.
