Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM 10/14/2020 TIME: 14:35 PM CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluate ejection fraction and wall motion abnormalities due to previous myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated 07/12/2019. FINDINGS: Left ventricular chamber size is normal with a mildly reduced ejection fraction estimated at 40%. There is mild global hypokinesis, most pronounced in the basal inferior segments. No significant valvular abnormalities noted. Left atrial size is mildly enlarged. There are no pericardial effusions. Doppler study shows normal valvular flow velocities and patterns. The aorta is normal in size and contour. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mildly reduced ejection fraction, consistent with mild global systolic dysfunction. 2. No significant valvular heart disease identified.
