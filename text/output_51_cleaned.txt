Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 10/15/2021 at 1:30 PM CLINICAL INDICATION: Assessment for myocardial viability in a 54-year-old male with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram 08/22/2021 TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MRI system following the Heart Health Institute comprehensive cardiac protocol. FINDINGS: The left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated at 32%, indicating reduced systolic function. There is evidence of extensive myocardial scarring involving the mid to apical segments of the left ventricle. Delayed enhancement was noted, corresponding to non-viable myocardium predominantly in the anterior wall. No evidence of thrombus in the left ventricular cavity. Right ventricular size and function are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction consistent with known ischemic cardiomyopathy. 2. Extensive myocardial scar noted, particularly affecting the anterior wall, consistent with prior myocardial infarction. Further therapeutic decisions should be based on a multidisciplinary discussion, considering the extent of non-viable myocardium.
