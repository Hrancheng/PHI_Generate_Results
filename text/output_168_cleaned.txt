Example 21:
MRI SPINE LUMBAR WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 10/05/2022. CLINICAL INDICATION: Chronic lower back pain with history of previous lumbar surgical interventions. COMPARISON: MRI dated 04/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: Standard non-contrast lumbar spine MRI protocol was utilized. FINDINGS: The lumbar spine shows post-surgical changes with evidence of laminectomy at L4 and L5. There is mild recurrent disc protrusion at L4-L5 that is impinging on the thecal sac but not severely affecting the nerve roots. Mild facet joint arthrosis is noted at L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels. No significant canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing is evident. Bone marrow signal is unremarkable. The conus medullaris terminates at the appropriate level, and the cauda equina nerve roots appear normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. Post-surgical changes at L4 and L5 with mild recurrent disc protrusion at L4-L5.
2. No significant canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
3. Mild facet joint arthrosis at L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels.
