Example 21:
ECHO CARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 07/22/2021. CLINICAL INDICATOR: Evaluation of cardiac murmurs. HISTORY: Known bicuspid aortic valve. COMPARISONS: Previous Echocardiogram on 06/18/2020. TECHNIQUE: Transthoracic echocardiogram performed with representative 2D imaging, Doppler, and color flow at Riverdale Cardiac Clinic. FINDINGS: The left ventricle is normal in size with preserved systolic function; estimated ejection fraction is 60%. No wall motion abnormalities were noted. The right ventricle is normal in size and function. The aortic valve appears bicuspid with mild aortic stenosis noted. There is mild aortic valve calcification. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened but open well with no significant mitral regurgitation. Tricuspid and pulmonary valves appear normal without significant regurgitation. No significant pericardial effusion. The aorta is normal in caliber. IMPRESSION: Patient's echocardiogram demonstrates a stable bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis and no significant change compared to the previous study. Recommendations for follow-up echo in one year or sooner if clinically indicated.
