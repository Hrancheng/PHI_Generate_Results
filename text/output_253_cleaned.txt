Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 9/15/2021. HISTORY: Evaluation for suspected cardiomyopathy. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram 3/12/2020. FINDINGS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated at 45%, indicating mild systolic dysfunction. The left ventricle is mildly dilated. Normal right ventricular size and function. Normal left atrial and right atrial sizes. There is mild mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion. No intracardiac thrombus. The aortic valve appears structurally normal with no significant stenosis or regurgitation. The pulmonary valve is unremarkable. Doppler study shows normal flow across the mitral and aortic valves. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. 2. Mild mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation. No evidence of significant valvular heart disease.
