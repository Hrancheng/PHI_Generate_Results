Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI, dated 07/15/2021 TIME: 14:30 PM INDICATION: Evaluation of myocardial viability and cardiomyopathy. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram 12/05/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla machine employing cardiac gating with late gadolinium enhancement sequences used to assess myocardial scar tissue. FINDINGS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is noted to be 40%, consistent with mild to moderate systolic dysfunction. The left ventricular cavity size is at the upper limits of normal. Late gadolinium enhancement indicates a small, non-transmural scar in the inferolateral wall, suggesting prior myocardial injury. Right ventricle appears normal in size and function. No evidence of right ventricular dysplasia. The cardiac valves appeared morphologically normal without significant regurgitation or stenosis on MR imaging. The pericardium is normal. No evidence of myocardial edema to suggest active myocarditis. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild to moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a small inferolateral scar - likely indicative of prior myocardial infarction. 2. No evidence of significant valvular disease or active myocarditis.
