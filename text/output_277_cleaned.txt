Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 10/5/2021 2:30 PM INDICATION: 58-year-old male patient with suspicious coronary anomalies noted in prior CT angiography. COMPARISON: Previous cardiac MRI dated 4/12/2020. TECHNIQUE: Utilizing a 3 Tesla MRI machine at Heart Care Imaging Center utilizing standard coronary visualization protocols. FINDINGS: The major coronary arteries demonstrate normal origin and course with no significant stenosis or occlusion. Mild diffuse thickening of the left ventricular myocardium is noted, consistent with hypertrophic changes but no marked left ventricular outflow obstruction. No evidence of myocardial scar or ischemic change on delayed gadolinium-enhanced images. Valvular structures appear intact and functional with trivial mitral regurgitation. No pericardial effusion or significant mass effect. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No significant coronary artery disease. 2. Mild hypertrophic changes in left ventricular myocardium without significant obstruction. 3. Trivial mitral regurgitation with overall stable cardiomuscular condition compared to previous study.
