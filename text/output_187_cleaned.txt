MRI BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, 9/29/2021 at 14:30. CLINICAL INDICATION: 58-year-old male presenting with new onset headaches and blurred vision. COMPARISON: MRI dated 8/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: 1. MRI performed on a 3 Tesla using the Cleveland Clinic standard brain protocol. Imaging sequences included T1, T2, FLAIR, and DWI, followed by the administration of 15 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast without adverse reaction. FINDINGS: There is a 3 cm enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe which demonstrates ring enhancement on post-contrast images, suspect high-grade glioma. No evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarction. There is mild midline shift to the right. Cerebral ventricles are normal in size and configuration. Minor white matter changes consistent with microvascular ischemia. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Suspected high-grade glioma in the left temporal lobe with associated edema and mild midline shift. 2. No acute hemorrhage or infarction. 3. Stable white matter changes when compared to previous MRI.
