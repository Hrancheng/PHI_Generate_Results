ULTRASOUND OF THE THYROID 10/21/2022 CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of thyroid nodules diagnosed previously. HISTORY: Patient experiences occasional throat discomfort and has a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. COMPARISON: Ultrasound 5/15/2020 FINDINGS: The thyroid gland appears heterogeneous in echotexture, which is consistent with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. The right thyroid lobe measures 4.0 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm and the left lobe measures 3.8 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm. There are several nodules noted: Nodule #1: Located in the right lobe, mid portion, measuring 0.5 x 0.6 cm, hypoechoic, with ill-defined margins, no microcalcifications. Nodule #2: Located in the left lobe, upper pole, measuring 0.3 x 0.4 cm, isoechoic, with clearer margins, no significant vascular flow on Doppler. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multinodular goiter with background heterogeneous echotexture suggestive of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. 2. No evidence of malignancy within the nodules examined. Recommendations: Follow-up ultrasound in one year to monitor nodule size and characteristic changes.
