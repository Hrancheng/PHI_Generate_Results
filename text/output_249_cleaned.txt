There are no signs of intra-tumoral hemorrhage or significant mass effect. The ventricles and sulci appear normal in size and configuration. No new focal lesion is identified. No evidence of acute infarction or abnormal enhancement. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable appearance of known right hemispheric meningioma without interval change. 2. No new intracranial abnormalities. Suggested clinical follow-up with repeat imaging in one year or sooner if symptoms change.
