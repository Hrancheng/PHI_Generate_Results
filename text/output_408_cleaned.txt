Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI 09/11/2021. CLINICAL HISTORY: Assessment of myocardial viability post myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram dated 08/03/2021. IMPRESSION: Overall improvement in left ventricular function with previous wall motion abnormalities now less evident. No new areas of delayed enhancement suggesting no new myocardial scarring. Adequate left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction estimated at 55%. No significant valvular abnormalities noted. Recommendations for subsequent follow-up and possible stress testing to evaluate for ischemia as clinically indicated.
