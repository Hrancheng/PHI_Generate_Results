Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI with and without gadolinium, dated 09/15/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for myocardial viability after recent myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram dated 08/01/2021. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed using a 1.5 Tesla magnet with dedicated cardiac coils. Sequences included steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine imaging, T2-weighted imaging for edema, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging for fibrosis and scar. FINDINGS: Left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 40%. Transmural late enhancement noted in the anterior wall suggesting myocardial scarring. No evidence of pericardial effusion or significant valvular disease. 
IMPRESSION:
1. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with transmural scarring of the anterior wall.
2. No pericardial effusion or significant valvular abnormalities.
