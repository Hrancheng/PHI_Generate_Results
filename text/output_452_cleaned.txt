MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 10/14/2021. HISTORY: New-onset seizures. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner at Riverdale Medical Imaging Center. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of mass effect, midline shift, or intracranial hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. No abnormal signal intensity within the brain parenchyma. The major intracranial flow voids are present and normal. No enhancing lesions are identified following the administration of Gadolinium-based contrast. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology detected, stable when compared to prior imaging. Follow-up or additional diagnostic testing may be considered if clinically indicated.
