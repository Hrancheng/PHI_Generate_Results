Example 21:
MRI LOWER EXTREMITY WITHOUT CONTRAST, 09/18/2021 10:30 AM INDICATION: 55-year-old male with a history of chronic knee pain and suspected meniscal tear. COMPARISON: MRI of the lower extremity dated 03/15/2019. TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MRI of the knee was performed using a 1.5 Tesla magnet. Axial, sagittal, and coronal views were obtained to evaluate the structures of the knee thoroughly.
FINDINGS:
- The medial meniscus shows a complex tear extending from the posterior horn to the body with associated extrusion. The lateral meniscus appears intact.
- Moderate joint effusion.
- No evidence of cruciate or collateral ligament tear.
- The quadriceps and patellar tendons are intact.
- Mild degenerative changes noted in the patellofemoral and medial knee compartments with no significant bone marrow edema.
- Articular cartilage of the lateral compartment is preserved.
IMPRESSION:
1. Complex tear of the medial meniscus with extrusion.
2. Mild degenerative changes in the patellofemoral and medial compartments suggestive of early osteoarthritis.
3. No ligamentous or major tendon injury. 
4. Moderate joint effusion.
These findings will be thoroughly explained to the patient, and surgical options may be considered based on symptomatology and functional impairment. Follow-up consultation is scheduled for 10/05/2021 with Dr. Harold Greene in the orthopedics department.
