ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 9/15/2021
---------------------------------------------------
PATIENT NAME: Robert Thompson
PROCEDURE: Transthoracic Echocardiogram
INDICATION: Evaluation of left ventricular function and valve abnormalities.
TECHNIQUE: Standard transthoracic windows with 2D imaging, Doppler, and color flow mapping.
FINDINGS:
- The left ventricle is normal in size with preserved systolic function; ejection fraction estimated at 55%.
- No regional wall motion abnormalities are detected.
- The right ventricle is normal in size and function.
- Valves: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened but demonstrate normal mobility. No significant mitral regurgitation. The aortic valve is trileaflet with no significant stenosis or regurgitation.
- The tricuspid valve and pulmonary valve are unremarkable with no evidence of significant stenosis or regurgitation.
- Pericardium: There is no pericardial effusion.
- Chambers: The atria are normal in size.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.
2. Mild mitral valve leaflet thickening without significant dysfunction.
3. No evidence of significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation.
4. No pericardial effusion.
COMMENTS:
The patient's echocardiographic evaluation shows overall normal cardiac structure and function with mild mitral valve leaflet thickening. No urgent concerns. Recommend follow-up as clinically indicated.
