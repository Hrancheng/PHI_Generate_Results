Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 7/15/2021 INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected myocarditis in a 32-year-old patient with recent viral infection and persistent chest pain. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram dated 6/10/2021. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla magnet with both T1 and T2-weighted imaging, early and late gadolinium enhancement studies. The entire cardiac anatomy was assessed from base to apex, including visualization of the pericardium and surrounding structures. FINDINGS: There is mild global hypokinesis of the left ventricle. T2-weighted images show increased signal in the myocardium suggestive of edema. Late gadolinium enhancement demonstrates subepicardial enhancement in the lateral wall of the left ventricle, consistent with myocarditis. No evidence of myocardial infarction or fibrosis. The right ventricle and pericardium appear normal. IMPRESSION: 1. Findings are consistent with myocarditis. Persistent myocardial edema and characteristic late gadolinium enhancement patterns support this diagnosis. 2. No evidence of chronic myocardial scarring or infarction. Follow-up MRI in six months is recommended to assess myocardial recovery.
