Example 21:
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 09/27/2023 11:20 AM 
INDICATION: 52-year-old male with recent onset of severe abdominal pain and weight loss.
COMPARISON: Abdominal ultrasound from 08/15/2023.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT was performed of the abdomen and pelvis utilizing oral and IV contrast. Sequential axial images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis, followed by coronal and sagittal reconstructions.
FINDINGS: 
Liver: No hepatic lesions or biliary dilatation. The hepatic texture is homogenous. 
Pancreas: No evidence of mass or significant pancreatic duct dilatation. 
Kidneys: Both kidneys are normal in size and contour without evidence of stones or hydronephrosis.
Adrenals: Unremarkable.
Spleen: Normal in size and echotexture without focal lesions.
Bladder: Normal in capacity and wall thickness with no intra-luminal filling defects.
Lymph Nodes: No pathologically enlarged abdominal or pelvic lymph nodes.
Bowel: No obstruction. Wall thickening seen in the ascending colon with surrounding fat stranding suggesting colitis. Recommend clinical correlation.
Bone Structures: Normal appearance of the visualized osseous structures without lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and bladder.
2. Wall thickening and fat stranding at the ascending colon likely represent colitis; clinical correlation is recommended.
3. No evidence of metastatic disease or significant lymphadenopathy.
