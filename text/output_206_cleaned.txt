Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WO/W CONTRAST, dated 9/15/2020, 11:00 AM INDICATION: 58-year-old female with history of progressive memory loss and suspected early onset Alzheimer's disease. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated 1/12/2020. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the brain was performed using high-resolution 3T equipment at City Neurology Clinic. FINDINGS: The cerebral cortex and hippocampal volumes are reduced, consistent with the patient's clinical diagnosis. There are scattered foci of white matter T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical regions, typical for microvascular changes. No mass effect or midline shift. The major intracranial vessels demonstrate patent flow voids. Ventricles are symmetric and within normal limits for the patient's age. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Brain atrophy with features suggesting neurodegenerative changes, likely Alzheimer's disease. 2. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes. Recommendations include clinical correlation with neuropsychological testing and follow-up imaging in one year or sooner if clinically indicated.
