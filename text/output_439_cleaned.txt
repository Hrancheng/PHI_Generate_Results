Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated 09/14/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected multiple sclerosis. HISTORY: Increasing episodes of dizziness and weakness over the past month. COMPARISON: MRI brain dated 07/02/2020. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequential MRI of the brain was performed without and with Gadolinium contrast on a 1.5 Tesla system. FINDINGS: There are several well-circumscribed areas of high T2/FLAIR signal within the periventricular white matter bilaterally, likely representing demyelinating plaques. The largest plaque is noted in the right frontal lobe measuring 0.9 x 1.2 cm. There is no significant mass effect or midline shift. No new lesions when compared to previous study dated 07/02/2020. Gadolinium enhancement of the plaques was not observed, indicating no active inflammation. Ventricular size and configuration are normal. The sella and pituitary gland appear normal. Visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: Multiple high-signal lesions consistent with demyelinating disease, most consistent with multiple sclerosis in the absence of new active lesions or enhanced plaques since 07/02/2020. Further clinical correlation is recommended.
