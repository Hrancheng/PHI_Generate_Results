Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 04/22/2021 2:15 PM INDICATION: Evaluation of possible myocarditis in a 52-year-old male with recent COVID-19 infection. COMPARISON: Prior cardiac MRI 03/19/2021. TECHNIQUE: MRI is performed on a 3 Tesla magnet. Pre- and post-contrast sequences were acquired including T2-weighted images for edema, T1-weighted images for fat saturation, and late gadolinium enhancement sequences. FINDINGS: The myocardium exhibits mildly increased T2 signal suggesting mild myocardial edema. Late gadolinium enhancement images show small areas of enhancement in the mid myocardial wall of the basal inferolateral segment, consistent with myocarditis. The left ventricular systolic function is preserved with an ejection fraction measured at 56%. Right ventricular size and function are normal. No pericardial effusion is evident. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Findings suggestive of mild myocarditis, likely post-viral, correlating with recent COVID-19 infection. Continued follow-up recommended to monitor resolution or progression. 2. No significant cardiac chamber enlargement or acute injury findings.
