Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST dated 10/15/2021 CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for myocardial scar and ischemia. HISTORY: 55-year-old male with recent onset of atypical chest pain, possible ischemic symptoms. COMPARISON: Prior echocardiogram dated 08/03/2021. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed with gadolinium-based contrast agent, ECG-gating and breath-hold instructions. FINDINGS: The myocardium demonstrates normal wall thickness and motion. No evidence of focal wall motion abnormalities or myocardial thinning. Delayed hyperenhancement sequences show no areas of myocardial scarring or fibrosis, suggesting a low likelihood of significant ischemic injury. No evidence of pericardial effusion or significant valvular abnormalities. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction measured at 62%. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of myocardial scarring or ischemic injury. 2. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
