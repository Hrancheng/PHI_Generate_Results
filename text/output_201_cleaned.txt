Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 9/15/2022 CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for demyelinating disease. HISTORY: Recent onset of visual disturbances and dysphasia. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated July 7, 2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner utilizing sequences including FLAIR, T2-weighted, T1-weighted post-contrast, and diffusion-weighted imaging. Gadolinium contrast was administered without incident. FINDINGS: There are several new white matter lesions on FLAIR and T2-weighted images predominantly involving the periventricular and subcortical regions. These lesions exhibit characteristics suggestive of demyelinating plaques. There is no abnormal enhancement to suggest active demyelination. The rest of the brain parenchyma is unremarkable with no evidence of mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size. The major intracranial vessels show no significant narrowing or occlusion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Several new lesions compatible with demyelinating disease. 2. No evidence of active disease on post-contrast images. Follow-up MRI recommended in six months or sooner if clinically indicated.
