Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH GADOLINIUM 07/15/2022 TIME OF PROCEDURE: 10:30 AM INDICATION: Suspected myocarditis. 28-year-old male with recent viral illness. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla machine using a Cleveland Clinic specific cardiac protocol with and without gadolinium enhancement. FINDINGS: The left ventricle demonstrates normal size and function with an ejection fraction estimated at 55%. There is evidence of late gadolinium enhancement in the mid-myocardial layer of the lateral wall suggesting myocardial inflammation. No evidence of infarction or fibrosis. The right ventricle and atria appeared normal. The pericardium is unremarkable without effusion. IMPRESSION: 1. Findings suggestive of acute myocarditis with involvement of the lateral myocardial wall. MRI features correlate with the clinical suspicion of myocarditis based on recent history. Further clinical correlation and follow-up are recommended to monitor therapeutic response if treatment is initiated.
