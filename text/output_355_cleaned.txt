Example 21:
ABDOMINAL CT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 9/15/2022. CLINICAL INDICATION: 54-year-old male with history of intermittent abdominal pain and weight loss. COMPARISON: CT abdomen from 3/28/2022, Ultrasound dated 1/10/2022. TECHNIQUE: Multi-phase abdominal CT was performed using 100 mL of non-ionic contrast. Axial, coronal, and sagittal images were obtained and reviewed. FINDINGS: The liver is enlarged with a heterogeneous appearance, suggesting cirrhotic changes. Multiple low-attenuation lesions consistent with hepatic cysts are noted, the largest measuring 3 cm. The spleen is mildly enlarged at 12 cm. No ascites or lymphadenopathy is evident. The pancreas is unremarkable without evidence of mass or cyst. Adrenal glands are normal. Kidneys demonstrate bilateral simple cysts, largest on the right measuring 2 cm. No hydronephrosis or stones. The gallbladder has gallstones each measuring up to 1 cm, without evidence of cholecystitis. The stomach and bowel loops are normal. No evidence of obstruction or significant wall thickening. Trace free fluid noted in the pelvis. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Cirrhotic liver with multiple hepatic cysts. 2. Splenomegaly without associated findings. 3. Gallstones without cholecystitis. 4. Mild pelvis free fluid, likely physiological.
