Example 21:
MRI KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 07/07/2021 at 10:30 AM. INDICATION: 32-year-old male with chronic knee pain because of a previous sports injury. COMPARISON: MRI dated 06/15/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI scans were performed on a 1.5 Tesla unit using a dedicated knee coil. Sequences included T1, T2, and PD fat-suppressed axial, coronal, and sagittal views. IMPRESSION: FINDINGS: The visualized portions of the femur and tibia show normal bone marrow signal without evidence of fracture or contusion. There is mild joint effusion. The anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament appear intact. Evidence of a previous meniscal repair at the medial meniscus; however, a new minimal peripheral tear at the lateral meniscus is noted. The cartilage surfaces are otherwise preserved without significant degenerative changes. IMPRESSION: 1. No fracture or significant bony abnormality. 2. Mild knee joint effusion. 3. Status post medial meniscus repair with minimal new peripheral tear of the lateral meniscus. Suggest clinical correlation for symptoms.
