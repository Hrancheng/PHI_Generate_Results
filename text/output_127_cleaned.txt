BRAIN MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 11/14/2022 TIME: 3:00 PM CLINICAL INDICATION: 55-year-old male with headaches and recent onset confusion. COMPARISON: MRI Brain dated 10/10/2022. TECHNIQUE: A 1.5 Tesla MRI machine was used, employing a standard brain protocol with and without gadolinium contrast. Findings: The MRI revealed a 2.1 cm enhancing lesion within the left parietal lobe suggestive of primary brain neoplasm. There is mild mass effect with slight midline shift. No significant surrounding vasogenic edema. T1 and T2 images show differential characteristics consistent with glioma. No evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarction. The remainder of the brain parenchyma appears normal. Visualized portions of the orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air cells are unremarkable. Impression: 1. Left parietal lobe mass consistent with high-grade glioma. Re-evaluation with biopsy recommended for definitive diagnosis. 2. Mild mass effect with slight midline shift. 3. No acute hemorrhage or infarction. Recommendations: Neurosurgical consultation and possible stereotactic biopsy for histological confirmation and treatment planning. Continuation of antiedema therapy and close clinical follow-up advised.
