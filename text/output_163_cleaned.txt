Example 21:
THORACIC SPINE MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 10/22/2021, TIME: 3 PM. INDICATION: Evaluate for spinal metastasis in a 54-year-old male with known prostate cancer. Comparison: MRI 5/28/2021. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla machine, utilizing T1, T2, and STIR sequences in multiple planes. Gd contrast was injected without any adverse reaction. FINDINGS: The thoracic spine shows no evidence of metastatic disease. Vertebral body heights and alignment are maintained. No significant disc degeneration or protrusions. The spinal cord is normal in caliber and signal. There are no signs of cord compression or significant stenosis. The paravertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. Minimal degenerative changes are noted in the facet joints. IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease to the thoracic spine. Stable when compared to previous study. Recommend follow-up as clinically indicated.
