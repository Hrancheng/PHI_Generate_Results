Example 21:
Procedure: MRI BRAIN DATE 9/14/2023 Clinical Indication: Evaluate for demyelinating disease. History: Suspected multiple sclerosis. Comparison: None. Findings: The MRI demonstrates multiple white matter lesions in the periventricular and subcortical areas, consistent with demyelinating plaques. The largest lesion measures approximately 1.2 cm in the right frontal lobe. No evidence of malignant transformation. Normal ventricular size and configuration. The cerebellum and brainstem are unremarkable. Technique: MRI was performed using a multi-sequence, multi-planar approach, without and with gadolinium enhancement. Impression: 1. Multiple white matter lesions suggestive of multiple sclerosis. 2. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial mass effect. Further clinical correlation and possibly a follow-up MRI in six months are recommended to evaluate progression.
