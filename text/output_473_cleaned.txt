- No aneurysm, vascular malformation, or significant stenosis.  
- The visualized portions of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries were unremarkable without evidence of vasospasm or occlusion.  
- Venous phase shows normal opacification with no evidence of thrombosis or anomaly.   
IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of cerebral aneurysm or vascular malformation.  
2. Normal cerebral angiogram.
