Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 11/28/2022 CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluate for possible multiple sclerosis. Comparison: MRI from 10/15/2021 TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the brain without and with IV contrast on a 3.0 Tesla unit. T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, and post-contrast T1 sequences were performed. FINDINGS: There are several new periventricular and subcortical white matter hyperintensities on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, consistent with active demyelination. No enhancement of these lesions with contrast, suggesting no active breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. New lesion in the left frontal lobe measures 3 mm. No evidence of mass effect or midline shift. Intracranial major vessels and venous sinuses appear patent. Previous lesions identified on 10/15/2021 scan appear stable with no new significant changes. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New non-enhancing demyelinating lesions compatible with active multiple sclerosis. No evidence of acute hemorrhage, infarction, or other acute findings. 2. No significant interval change in previously identified lesions.
