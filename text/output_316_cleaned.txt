Example 21:
CHEST X-RAY PA AND LATERAL 09/15/2021 10:30 AM CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for suspected pneumonia. COMPARISON: Chest x-ray from 08/01/2021. FINDINGS: The lung fields show patchy areas of increased opacity in the right lower lobe consistent with infiltrates. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for age and configuration. Osseous structures are intact with no acute abnormalities noted. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. New right lower lobe infiltrates likely represent pneumonia. Recommend clinical correlation and possibly antibiotic therapy depending on clinical symptoms.
