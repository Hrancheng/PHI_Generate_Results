Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 10/14/2020. INDICATION: 58-year-old female with history of migraine and recent onset of visual disturbances. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated 8/8/2019. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner using a standard brain protocol. Pre- and post-contrast sequences were obtained without complications.
FINDINGS:
The brain parenchyma shows normal morphology without evidence of mass, hemorrhage, or acute ischemic changes. There is no midline shift. The ventricles and sulci are of normal size and configuration. There is a stable appearance of a small pineal cyst measuring 5 mm, unchanged from the prior study.
Post-contrast images show no abnormal enhancement to suggest active disease. The major intracranial vessels appear patent with normal flow voids. The visualized orbits, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
2. Stable small pineal cyst.
3. No findings to suggest a secondary cause for visual disturbances. Further clinical evaluation and possibly a neuro-ophthalmologic assessment are recommended.
