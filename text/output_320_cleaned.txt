Example 21:
BRAIN MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 9/13/2022. CLINICAL INDICATION: 53-year-old male with new onset seizures and headaches. COMPARISON: Prior MRI dated 8/1/2022. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence, multi-planar MRI of the brain was performed with and without gadolinium contrast on a 1.5 Tesla scanner at City Hospital. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage. The ventricular system is of normal size and configuration. There is no midline shift. Post-contrast images show no abnormal enhancement to suggest a mass lesion or active inflammatory disease. Minimal white matter hyperintensities likely represent mild chronic small vessel ischemic changes. The pituitary and pineal glands are normal in appearance. The major intracranial vessels show patent flow voids. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Stable appearance compared to previous MRI dated 8/1/2022. Follow-up with neurology recommended for further evaluation of seizures.
