Example 21:  
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 6/21/2022, Time of Exam: 08:30 AM  
INDICATION: 53-year-old female patient with new-onset seizures.  
COMPARISON: MRI from 5/15/2022.  
TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner using the Boston General Hospital comprehensive brain protocol. Post-contrast images obtained following distribution of 20 ml Gadovist.  
FINDINGS:  
1. There is no evidence of acute infarction.  
2. Normal morphology and signal of the cerebral lobes, basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum.  
3. There is a 2 mm focus of gadolinium enhancement in the left frontal lobe which may represent a small vascular malformation or a developing lesion. Further evaluation with MR angiography is suggested.  
4. Ventricles and sulci are within normal limits for patient age. No midline shift.  
5. No significant white matter hyperintensities or signs of demyelination.  
IMPRESSION:  
1. No acute brain injury or infarction.  
2. Small enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe, possibly vascular, merits further evaluation with focused MR angiography.  
3. Stable exam compared to the last MRI dated 5/15/2022. No progression of any abnormal findings.
