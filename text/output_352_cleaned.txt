Example 21:
ECHOCARDIOGRAM REPORT dated 04/28/2021 2:15 PM
INDICATION: Evaluation of suspected heart failure.
COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated 10/15/2020
TECHNIQUE: Standard transthoracic echocardiogram performed using Heart and Vascular Clinic's echocardiography protocol. Comprehensive 2D and Doppler echocardiographic examination completed.
FINDINGS: 
- The left ventricular ejection fraction is estimated at 45%, which is decreased compared to 55% observed on previous echocardiogram.
- Mild generalized hypokinesia is noted. No evidence of ventricular aneurysm.
- Diastolic dysfunction is present with abnormal relaxation pattern.
- The mitral valve shows mild regurgitation. 
- No significant aortic stenosis, the aortic valve presents trileaflet with mild regurgitation.
- Tricuspid and pulmonary valves are structurally normal with trivial regurgitations.
- Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is increased at 38 mmHg suggesting mild pulmonary hypertension.
IMPRESSION:
1. Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction with evidence of mild systolic dysfunction.
2. Diastolic dysfunction with abnormal relaxation, unchanged from prior.
3. Mild tricuspid, mitral and aortic regurgitations noted with an increased estimate of pulmonary artery pressure.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Continue monitoring cardiac function and consider echocardiogram in 6 months or sooner if symptoms persist or worsen.
- Consider evaluation for potential underlying causes of the cardiac dysfunction reported.
- Patient continued on current heart failure management regimen.
Patient was seen in consultation with Dr. Emily Stanton, Cardiology Associates. Follow-up appointment scheduled for 11/05/2021 at Clinic Room 204.
