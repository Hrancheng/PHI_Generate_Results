Example 21:
HEART ECHOGRAM: Comprehensive 7/25/2022
INDICATION:
Chest pain and dyspnea, evaluate for cardiac function and possible effusion.
HISTORY:
A previously reported MI in 2019 with recurring episodes of angina.
COMPARISON:
Previous echocardiogram dated 5/10/2020.
TECHNIQUE:
Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed using a Philips Epiq 5 cardiac ultrasound machine. Full 2D, M-Mode, Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging were utilized.
FINDINGS:
1. Left Ventricular Systolic Function: The left ventricular ejection fraction by Simpsonâ€™s biplane method is an estimated 45%, slightly reduced from previous measure of 50%.
2. Valves: The aortic and mitral valves show mild regurgitative changes without significant stenosis. Tricuspid and pulmonary valves are normal.
3. Chamber Sizes: Normal left atrial and ventricular chamber sizes.
4. Wall Motion: There is hypokinesis at the inferior wall, likely ischemic in origin.
5. Pericardium: No pericardial effusion is visible.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild decrease in left ventricular systolic function since last evaluation.
2. Persistent mild valve regurgitation without progression.
3. Stable chamber sizes with ongoing inferior wall motion abnormality suggestive of ischemia.
4. No evidence of pericardial effusion.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Clinical follow-up with repeat echocardiogram in 6 months. Discussion of findings and management options should be conducted with the referring physician or a cardiologist at Heart Care Associates.
