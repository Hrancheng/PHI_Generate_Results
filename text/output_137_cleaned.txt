Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 11/06/2022 10:30 AM INDICATION: 56-year-old male with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy. History of myocardial infarction and subsequent stenting. Follow-up for ventricular function assessment. COMPARISON: Cardiac MRI dated 10/11/2021. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed on a 3 Tesla scanner utilizing cine sequences, delayed gadolinium enhancement, and black-blood imaging for myocardial scar assessment. FINDINGS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is calculated at 32% consistent with moderate to severe systolic dysfunction. Diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricular wall noted, more pronounced in the inferior and lateral walls. Delayed enhancement sequences show extensive myocardial scarring, consistent with previous ischemic injury, mainly in the mid to distal segments of the left ventricular wall. The right ventricle appears normal in size and function. Valvular structures visualized indicate mild mitral regurgitation and trivial aortic regurgitation. No pericardial effusion or significant pleural fluid accumulation is seen. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiac MRI findings consistent with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction.
2. Extensive myocardial scarring observed, particularly in the inferior and lateral segments of the left ventricle.
3. Mild mitral and trivial aortic regurgitation without hemodynamic compromise.
