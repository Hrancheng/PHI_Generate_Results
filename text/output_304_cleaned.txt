CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, 10/22/2021 2:00 PM INDICATION: 63-year-old female with history of colorectal cancer s/p hemicolectomy. Assess for metastasis. COMPARISON: CT from 01/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: Multi-detector CT scan performed with oral and IV contrast. Sequential images obtained from diaphragm to pubic symphysis at 5 mm intervals. FINDINGS: The liver shows multiple low-density lesions consistent with metastases, the largest measuring 2 cm in segment IV. No biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is normal in appearance. The pancreas is unremarkable. Adrenal glands are normal. There is no lymphadenopathy. The spleen shows mild splenomegaly without focal lesions. The kidneys are normal in size and morphology with no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones. The urinary bladder is unremarkable. There are post-surgical changes in the right hemiabdomen consistent with prior hemicolectomy. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple hepatic lesions likely represent metastatic disease. 2. No evidence of extrahepatic spread. 3. Mild splenomegaly.
