Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI EXAM dated 3/15/2021 at 10:30 AM. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for possible cardiomyopathy. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram 1/28/2021. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed including sequences in multiple planes with and without gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: The left ventricular chamber size is normal with preserved systolic function; ejection fraction calculated at 62%. There is mild left ventricular hypertrophy. No evidence of myocardial scar or delayed enhancement to suggest myocardial fibrosis or infiltration. Right ventricular size and function are within normal limits. Valvular structures appear intact with no significant stenosis or regurgitation. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Normal left ventricular size and systolic function with mild hypertrophy. 2. No evidence of myocardial fibrosis or infiltration.
