MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 4/11/2018 10:30 AM INDICATION: 58-year-old female with new onset seizures. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated 3/15/2018, 2/10/2018. TECHNIQUE: 1. MRI is performed on a 3 Tesla using the Bethesda North Hospital epilepsy protocol. Images obtained prior to and following the administration of 15 mL of Gadovist intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: Redemonstration of bilateral hippocampal atrophy without significant change from previous exams. No new abnormal enhancement or signal abnormality identified within the cerebral cortex or subcortical white matter. Ventricular size and sulcal pattern are stable when compared to previous studies. No evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage. The basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem appear normal. Cerebellar hemispheres show no focal lesion or abnormal enhancement. The visualized orbits, sellar, and parasellar regions are unremarkable. Mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No new lesions identified. Continued bilateral hippocampal atrophy consistent with patient's history of epilepsy. No acute intracranial process.
