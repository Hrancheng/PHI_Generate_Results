Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 09/14/2022 TIME: 2:00 PM INDICATION: 63-year-old male with history of myocarditis and recent worsening of heart failure symptoms. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram 08/08/2022. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the heart performed using a 3 Tesla machine with dynamic cine imaging and late gadolinium enhancement sequences. Images were obtained before and after the administration of 15 mL Gadavist. FINDINGS: The left ventricular cavity size is normal with a mildly reduced systolic function, estimated ejection fraction of 45%. There is patchy mid myocardial late gadolinium enhancement in the basal to mid inferolateral wall suggesting areas of fibrosis. No evidence of active inflammation. The right ventricle and atrial chambers appear normal. The pericardium is unremarkable without signs of effusion or constriction. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function likely secondary to chronic changes from previous myocarditis. 2. No evidence of ongoing myocardial inflammation.
