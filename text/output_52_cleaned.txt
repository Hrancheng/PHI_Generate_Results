MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 9/14/2021 at 10:30 AM. CLINICAL INDICATION: 72-year-old female with worsening headaches and history of hypertension. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated 8/20/2019. TECHNIQUE: High-resolution MRI performed using a 3 Tesla magnet at Regional Health Services. Pre- and post-contrast sequences were completed without any adverse reactions to the gadolinium-based contrast agent. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci are of normal size and configuration for the patientâ€™s age. There is no midline shift. Multiple small white matter hyperintensities are seen, likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No significant mass effect or mass lesions are visible. The pituitary gland, pineal gland, and major intracranial vessels show no abnormal enhancement. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute findings. Stable appearance compared to prior studies. 2. Multiple chronic small vessel ischemic changes. Recommended clinical correlation with neurology follow-up.
