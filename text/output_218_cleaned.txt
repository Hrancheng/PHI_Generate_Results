Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT GADOLINIUM, 11/14/2022 
INDICATION: Evaluation for myocardial viability post-James's myocardial infarction. 
COMPARISON: Previous cardiac MRI dated 10/10/2022. 
TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed using gadolinium contrast at North Valley Cardiac Center.
FINDINGS: 
- The left ventricular function appears reduced with a left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at approximately 30%. 
- No new areas of myocardial enhancement suggesting no additional myocardial damage since the last assessment.
- Patchy areas of delayed gadolinium enhancement noted in the septal and inferior walls, consistent with the known territory of previous myocardial infarction. 
- No evidence of thrombus formation in the ventricles or atria.
- Pericardium is normal without signs of effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable post-infarction changes with no new myocardial damage.
2. Reduced left ventricular function with ejection fraction approximately 30%. 
3. Follow up in 6 months or earlier if symptoms worsen.
