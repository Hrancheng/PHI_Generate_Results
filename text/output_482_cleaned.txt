Example 21:
CHEST X-RAY 10/11/2022. CLINICAL INDICATION: Persistent cough and suspected pneumonia. COMPARISON: Chest X-ray from 09/25/2022. FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior study shows progression of the previously noted right lower lobe infiltrate, now more confluent and consistent with ongoing infectious process. Increased bilateral hilar fullness, possibly representing lymphadenopathy. The cardiac silhouette appears stable with no overt signs of cardiomegaly. Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Worsened right lower lobe infiltrate since the last examination consistent with progression of pneumonia. Recommend clinical correlation and consideration of antibiotic therapy adjustment.
