Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI STUDY, dated 09/15/2021. INDICATION: Patient presenting with symptoms of increasing shortness of breath and suspected myocardial infarction. HISTORY: Prior history of coronary artery disease with stenting in 2019. COMPARISON: Previous cardiac MRI dated 03/20/2019. TECHNIQUE: Multi-sequence cardiac MRI performed using a 3.0 Tesla magnet with SSFP cine imaging for function, delayed enhancement sequences for myocardial scarring, and perfusion sequences with intravenous gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: 1. The left ventricular cavity size and myocardial thickness are within normal limits. 2. There is evidence of subendocardial delayed enhancement in the basal inferolateral wall suggesting myocardial scarring, consistent with prior infarct. 3. Perfusion imaging shows no new areas of stress-induced ischemia. 4. Right ventricle, atria, and valves appeared structurally normal with no evidence of dysfunction. 5. No pericardial effusion is noted. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable appearance of previously documented myocardial scar in the basal inferolateral wall. 2. No evidence of new myocardial ischemia or infarct on today's study. 3. Recommend follow-up with clinical cardiology for ongoing management.
