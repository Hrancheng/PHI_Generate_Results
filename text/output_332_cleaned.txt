Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 07/24/2021 1:45 PM INDICATION: 59-year-old male with history of congestive heart failure and recent myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram dated 03/15/2021. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla system following the Mount Sinai Cardiac Imaging protocol. Images acquired pre and post administration of 20 mL Gadolinium-based contrast. FINDINGS: The left ventricle shows mild hypertrophy with preserved systolic function. Ejection fraction estimated at 45%. No significant wall motion abnormalities noted. Right ventricle is normal in size and function. The MRI also visualizes mild diffuse left atrial enlargement. No evidence of myocardial scar or delayed enhancement that would suggest myocardial fibrosis or infiltration. Valves appear structurally normal without significant regurgitation or stenosis. The aorta and major branch vessels are without aneurysm or dissection. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function. 2. No acute ischemic changes or myocardial fibrosis. 3. Normal valves and great vessels.
