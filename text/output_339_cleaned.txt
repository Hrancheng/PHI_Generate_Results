MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 9/14/2022 TIME: 14:30 PM INDICATION: 32-year-old female with new onset seizures. COMPARISON: MRI dated 8/5/2021. TECHNIQUE: 1.5 Tesla MRI was performed with axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Pre- and post-contrast images were acquired using gadolinium-based contrast agent. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. No abnormal mass lesion or sign of acute ischemia. Contrast enhancement is within normal limits, with no abnormal enhancement suggesting active inflammation or demyelinating disease. Mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses is noted. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology. 2. Stable MRI brain when compared to previous scans. No progressive disease identified. Follow-up MRI recommended in one year or sooner if clinically warranted.
