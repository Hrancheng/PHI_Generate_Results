MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 12/03/2022 2:15 PM INDICATION: 57-year-old male with history of recurring headaches, rule out intracranial pathology. COMPARISON: MRI of the brain dated 11/28/2022, 10/15/2022. TECHNIQUE: MRI performed on a 3 Tesla using the Central City Neurological Institute standard brain protocol. Pre and post-contrast sequences were obtained without complication. Images were reformatted in multiple planes for detailed analysis. FINDINGS: The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. No evidence of mass effect or midline shift. The pituitary gland is normal in appearance with no sign of enlargement or abnormal enhancement. The cerebral parenchyma shows no areas of abnormal signal intensity; no evidence of acute ischemia or hemorrhage. Post-contrast images do not demonstrate any enhancing lesions. The cerebellum, brainstem, and basal ganglia appear unremarkable. The visualized orbits and paranasal sinuses are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or acute ischemic changes. 2. Stable findings compared to previous studies.
