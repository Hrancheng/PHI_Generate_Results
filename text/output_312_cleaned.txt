MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 09/15/2022 INDICATION: 52-year-old male with chronic low back pain, rule out nerve root impingement. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated 8/21/2019. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla machine. Axial and sagittal T2-weighted as well as T1-weighted images without and with Gadolinium enhancement were obtained. FINDINGS: There is a moderate broad-based posterior disc protrusion at L4-L5 causing mild indentation on the thecal sac. No significant nerve root impingement is noted. Mild facet joint hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening are evident at multiple levels. No evidence of spinal canal or foraminal stenosis. The vertebral body heights and alignment are maintained. The conus medullaris and cauda equina appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No change in the moderate disc protrusion at L4-L5 when compared to the previous MRI. 2. No acute nerve root impingement. 3. Recommendations for conservative management with physical therapy and follow-up as needed.
