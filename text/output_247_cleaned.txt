Example 21:
MR ABDOMINAL SCAN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, 11/15/2022. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation for liver masses. COMPARISON: Prior CT scan 10/10/2022. TECHNIQUE: Multi-phase abdominal MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner at Central City Hospital. Pre and post-contrast images were obtained in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates three focal lesions. The largest lesion is in the right hepatic lobe, measuring approximately 3.5 cm in diameter, with enhancement post gadolinium. This is consistent with the previously identified hemangioma on CT. Two smaller lesions in the left hepatic lobe show characteristics suggestive of simple cysts, each measuring under 1 cm. Kidneys, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. No evidence of lymphadenopathy or free fluid. The gallbladder is normal in appearance with no stones or wall thickening. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable appearance of previously noted hemangioma in the right hepatic lobe. 2. Two small simple cysts in the left hepatic lobe, unchanged from prior examination. No aggressive features. 3. No new abnormalities identified. Recommendations for follow-up remain as per prior discussion with the referring physician, Dr. Emily Jensen at Central City Clinic.
