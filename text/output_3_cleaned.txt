Example 21:
PROCEDURE: MRI LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST 09/15/2022 CLINICAL INDICATION: Lower back pain with radiculopathy. 52-year-old male with history of chronic lumbar spondylosis. COMPARISON: 12/03/2019. TECHNIQUE: MRI was performed on a 3 Tesla magnet without the use of gadolinium-based contrast. Images were obtained in multiple planes with T1, T2, and STIR sequences. FINDINGS: There is multilevel degenerative disc disease most pronounced at L4-L5 and L5-S1. L4-L5 shows moderate disc bulge with bilateral foraminal narrowing, more severe on the right. L5-S1 demonstrates a broad-based disc protrusion impinging on the right S1 nerve root. There is mild canal stenosis at this level. The conus medullaris and cauda equina appear normal. No significant facet arthropathy. No evidence of acute fracture or marrow infiltrative process. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multilevel degenerative changes with the most significant findings at L4-L5 and L5-S1 contributing to patientâ€™s symptoms. 2. No evidence of cauda equina syndrome or acute nerve root compression requiring immediate surgical intervention.
