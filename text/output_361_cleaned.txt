NECK ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER 3/15/2021 CLINICAL HISTORY: Patient complaining of neck pain and swelling. COMPARISON: Prior ultrasound 12/25/2020. TECHNIQUE: Utilizing B-mode and color Doppler ultrasound, various views of the neck were examined systematically. FINDINGS: The thyroid gland appears overall normal in echotexture with the isthmus measuring 0.4 cm. Right lobe measures 4.0 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm, and left lobe measures 4.5 x 1.6 x 1.3 cm. No evidence of nodules or calcifications. The carotid arteries bilaterally show normal caliber and flow without any signs of stenosis or plaque formation. Jugular veins are patent without evidence of thrombosis. Minor lymph nodes are visible bilaterally in the neck, all less than 1 cm, consistent with reactive lymph nodes. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No thyroidal abnormalities detected. 2. Normal carotid and jugular vascular examination. 3. Reactive lymphadenopathy likely due to recent upper respiratory infection as per patient's clinical history.
