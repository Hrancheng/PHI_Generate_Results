Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST 9/15/2021 at 10:30 AM INDICATION: Evaluate for myocardial ischemia and viability. 52-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Last echocardiogram dated 7/1/2020. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI was performed utilizing a 1.5 Tesla system with gadolinium-based contrast administered intravenously without any adverse effects. Comprehensive dynamic cine imaging, delayed enhancement, and perfusion studies were undertaken. FINDINGS: The left ventricle demonstrated normal size and systolic function with an ejection fraction of approximately 60%. There is no evidence of myocardial thinning or aneurysm formation. Delayed hyper-enhancement consistent with myocardial fibrosis was noted in the inferolateral wall, indicating prior myocardial injury. Normal left atrial size and function. The right ventricle and both atria appear normal. The aortic root and visible great vessels did not display any significant stenosis or dilatation. No significant pericardial effusion was noted. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Cardiac structure and function are within normal limits with exception of localized myocardial fibrosis at the inferolateral wall likely related to previous myocardial infarction. 2. No new ischemic changes were observed.
