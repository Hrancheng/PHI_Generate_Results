Example 21:
THORACIC SPINE MRI dated 9/14/2021. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of chronic back pain with suspected thoracic disc herniation. COMPARISON: Previous MRI dated 8/21/2019. TECHNIQUE: Utilizing a 3.0 Tesla MRI, sagittal T1, T2, STIR, and axial T2-weighted images were obtained from T1 to L1 without the use of intravenous contrast.
FINDINGS: 
The thoracic vertebral bodies maintain normal height and alignment with no evidence of compression fracture. Intervertebral disc heights are preserved. There is a small central disc protrusion at T8-T9 without significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. The conus medullaris terminates at a normal level, and the cauda equina appears unremarkable. No pathologic enhancement or abnormal signal within the spinal cord.
IMPRESSION:
1. Small central disc protrusion at T8-T9 without significant spinal or foraminal narrowing.
2. No acute thoracic pathology noted. Continued monitoring and conservative management recommended for chronic back pain.
