Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 10/15/2022 at 2:45 PM. INDICATION: Evaluation of 54-year-old male with suspected myocardial fibrosis. HISTORY: Recent admission for congestive heart failure. COMPARISON: Echocardiogram dated 8/1/2022. TECHNIQUE: MRI is performed with both non-contrast and contrast sequences using a 3.0 Tesla scanner. The standard cardiac protocol was followed, including delayed enhancement sequences to assess for fibrosis. FINDINGS: The left ventricular function is mildly reduced with an ejection fraction estimated at 45%. There is diffuse myocardial enhancement consistent with fibrosis, particularly involving the mid myocardial segments. No evidence of myocardial infarction. Mild pericardial effusion is also noted. The right ventricle and atria are normal in size and function. The valves appear structurally unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Diffuse myocardial enhancement suggesting widespread fibrosis. 2. Mild reduction in left ventricular function. No acute infarct. 3. Mild pericardial effusion. Recommendations: Consider follow-up with a cardiac MRI in one year or sooner if symptoms worsen. Further evaluation with a cardiologist is advised to manage heart failure symptoms and optimize treatment.
