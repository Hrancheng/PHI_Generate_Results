Example 21:
CHEST CT WITH CONTRAST 10/14/2022 CLINICAL INDICATION: Suspected pulmonary embolism. COMPARISON: Prior chest x-ray dated 9/20/2022. TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT of the chest was performed after the intravenous administration of 100 mL of nonionic contrast material. Scans were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen. IMAGES: coronal, sagittal, and axial planes generated and reviewed. 
FINDINGS: 
The lungs demonstrate no acute pulmonary emboli. There is a 0.3 cm nodule in the right upper lobe, which appears benign and stable when compared to the previous examination. The bronchovascular markings are otherwise normal. 
Pleura: No pleural effusions or masses noted. 
The heart and pericardium: There is no pericardial effusion. The heart size is within normal limits for the patient's age. 
Aorta and great vessels: There are no aneurysms or dissection.
Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and upper kidneys are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2. Stable small right upper lobe nodule, likely benign.
3. No significant change in cardiac and pleural findings.
