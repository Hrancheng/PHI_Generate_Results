Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 09/10/2020. INDICATION: Suspected myocarditis. COMPARISON: Previous Echocardiogram dated 08/01/2020. TECHNIQUE: Comprehensive cardiac MRI performed on a 3 Tesla MRI system with the administration of 15 mL gadolinium-based contrast agent without complication. IMAGES: 25 sequences were obtained, covering the entire heart with specific emphasis on myocardial tissue characterization. FINDINGS: The left ventricle demonstrates normal size and systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55%. No significant wall motion abnormalities were noted. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is noted at the mid myocardium of the lateral wall, suggestive of myocardial fibrosis or inflammation consistent with myocarditis. The right ventricle was normal in size and function. No pericardial effusions. Valves appear structurally intact with no significant regurgitation. IMPRESSION: 1. Findings consistent with myocarditis, particularly involving the lateral wall myocardium. 2. Left ventricular function preserved. Recommend clinical correlation and follow-up MRI in 6 months to assess progression or resolution.
