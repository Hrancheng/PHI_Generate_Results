PROCEDURE: Comprehensive Echocardiogram 9/21/2023
INDICATION: Evaluation of cardiac structures and function due to recent onset of dyspnea.
TECHNIQUE: Standard transthoracic echocardiogram performed using a Philips Epiq 7 cardiac ultrasound machine. 
FINDINGS:
1. LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal size with estimated ejection fraction of 55%. No regional wall motion abnormalities were observed.
2. RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal in size and function.
3. VALVES: Mild tricuspid regurgitation, other valves are structurally normal with no significant stenosis or regurgitation.
4. ATRIA: Left and right atrial sizes are within normal limits.
5. PERICARDIUM: No evidence of pericardial effusion.
6. AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.
7. DOPPLER STUDY: Normal diastolic function. No signs of increased intracardiac pressures.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal echocardiographic study with mild tricuspid regurgitation.
2. No evidence of significant valve disease, pericardial effusion, or ventricular systolic dysfunction.
FOLLOW-UP:
Recommend follow-up in one year or sooner if symptoms change.
