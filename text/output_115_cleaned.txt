Example 21:
CARDIAC MRI WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 9/25/2022 at 14:45 hours CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of cardiac structure and function post-myocardial infarction. COMPARISON: Previous echocardiogram 8/1/2022. TECHNIQUE: Cardiac MRI performed using a standard cardiomyopathy protocol including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and late gadolinium enhancement sequences, without complications. 20 mL of gadolinium-based contrast agent was administered intravenously. FINDINGS: The left ventricular cavity size is normal with preserved wall thickness. Regional wall motion abnormalities were observed in the inferior wall, consistent with an area of prior infarct. Late gadolinium enhancement corroborates the presence of myocardial scar in the inferior wall. The right ventricle and atria are normal in size and function. Valves appear structurally intact without significant regurgitation. No evidence of pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable post-infarct changes in the inferior wall with myocardial scarring. 2. No new cardiac abnormalities identified. 3. Continued cardiac monitoring recommended.
