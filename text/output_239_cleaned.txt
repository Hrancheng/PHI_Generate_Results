Example 21:
MRI BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST, dated 10/28/2021 at 2:45 PM. CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluation of chronic headaches. COMPARISON: Previous CT scan of the head and prior MRI dated 1/15/2020. TECHNIQUE: MRI of the brain performed on a 1.5 Tesla magnet without the use of contrast agent. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage. Ventricular size and sulcal pattern are within normal limits for patient's age. There are no mass effects or midline shifts. White matter shows few nonspecific T2 hyperintense foci which are likely related to small vessel ischemic changes. The pituitary gland, craniocervical junction, and major intracranial vessels appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial abnormalities. 2. Stable appearance of nonspecific white matter changes when compared to previous imaging. Suggest clinical correlation for persistent symptoms.
