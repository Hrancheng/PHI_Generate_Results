**Hospital Course: Brief Overview**  
Mr. [B-NAME]Michael Thompson[O] was admitted following a severe chest pain episode while at work at [B-ORGANIZATION]Finch Technologies[O].

His post-operative course was complicated by transient acute kidney injury attributed to contrast use, which resolved with hydration and medical management.

The patient participated in daily cardiac rehabilitation sessions and responded well to guideline-directed medical therapy.
