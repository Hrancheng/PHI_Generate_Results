Inpatient Discharge Summary

Patient Information:
[B-NAME]Harold Clark[O], MRN# [B-ID]5234769[O], is a [B-AGE]65 y.o.[O] male, admitted due to complications related to type 2 diabetes and newly diagnosed congestive heart failure. 

Admission Date: [B-DATE]8/15/2021[O]
Discharge Date: [B-DATE]8/30/2021[O]

Hospital Course:
Mr. [B-NAME]Harold Clark[O] was admitted following a significant episode of dyspnea and dizziness after minimal exertion. He has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, for which he had been taking oral hypoglycemics irregularly. His admission was escalated by the emergency response team after performing initial diagnostics indicating elevated BNP and ECG changes suggestive of congestive heart failure. 

Initial management included establishing euvolemia, correcting electrolytes, and initiating insulin therapy. Notably, during his hospitalization, he experienced a mild non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which was medically managed without intervention due to high surgical risk. 

The patient's diabetes was managed with a new regimen of basal-bolus insulin post consultation with endocrinology, given the suboptimal control on oral medications. Cardiac function was assisted with the initiation of a beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretics. His diet was modified to low salt, heart-healthy options, and a diabetes educator provided comprehensive diabetic teaching.

The case was discussed thoroughly with the care team during bed-side rounds and additional consultations were made with the dietary team to ensure a personalized meal plan that addresses both his diabetes and heart conditions.
