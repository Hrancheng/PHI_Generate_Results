Hospital Course:
[B-NAME]Mr. Finch[O]'s hospital stay was complicated by a confirmed non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Initial management included dual antiplatelet therapy and high-dose statins. Coronary angiography performed on [B-DATE]February 21, 2023[O] revealed significant left anterior descending artery stenosis, for which he underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement.

Post-procedure, the patient showed excellent recovery with resolution of chest pain and stabilization of cardiac enzymes. Echocardiography indicated preserved left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 60%. He was monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit for 48 hours before stepping down to the cardiology ward.

Challenges during the stay included transient acute kidney injury likely linked to contrast use, which resolved with hydration and careful monitoring of renal function.

Discharge Medications:
1. Aspirin 81 mg daily
2. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 12 months
