**Chief Complaint:**  
Chest pain and elevated blood pressure

**Hospital Course:**  
Mr. [B-NAME]Thompson[O] was admitted on [B-DATE]10/05/2023[O] following an episode of severe chest pain and a recorded blood pressure of 190/100 mmHg at the local clinic.

Nephrology also evaluated Mr. [B-NAME]Thompson[O] due to acute kidney injury likely due to contrast but has shown improvement with IV fluids.
