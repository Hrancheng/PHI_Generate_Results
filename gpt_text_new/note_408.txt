**Hospital Course**:
Ms. [B-NAME]Elsa Martin[O] was admitted following increasing episodes of shortness of breath and swelling in her lower extremities. Initial evaluation indicated acute decompensation of chronic heart failure associated with her underlying renal insufficiency. Management included intravenous diuretics, adjustment of her heart failure medications, and closely monitored fluid management due to her renal status.

Nephrology was involved given her baseline renal impairment. Renal function was monitored daily, balancing the need for aggressive diuresis with the danger of exacerbating kidney injury. Her diuretics were adjusted, leading to gradual improvement in her fluid status and kidney function markers.

**Outcomes**:  
At discharge, her heart function had stabilized, and kidney function returned to baseline. She was transitioned to oral diuretics. Counseling was provided about fluid and diet restrictions.

**Medications at Discharge**:  
1. Furosemide 40 mg daily
