Hospital Course: Brief Overview
Mr. [B-NAME]Markus Greeley[O] arrived in mild distress with a history of chronic heart failure. Initial vitals showed elevated blood pressure and heart rate. IV diuretics were administered promptly to manage fluid overload, monitored by daily weight and urine output. Patient's renal function was closely observed, given a past medical history of chronic kidney disease, and managed accordingly with adjustments in medication dosages as renal function fluctuated over duration of stay.

Patient's pressor support was gradually tapered as blood pressure stabilized. Initiations of a beta-blocker and adjustment of ACE inhibitor dosages were successful in managing cardiac function and blood pressure. Sodium restriction and fluid management education were provided extensively by the dietetics team.

Discharge Plans:
Heart function stabilized with medical regimen adjusted as follows:
- Continue furosemide 40 mg twice daily
- Lisinopril dosage adjusted to 10 mg daily 
- Potassium levels to be monitored bi-weekly by GP
- Strict fluid and sodium restrictions advised

Discharge Medications:
- Furosemide 40 mg, oral, twice daily
- Lisinopril 10 mg, oral, once daily

- Echocardiogram on [B-DATE]9/22/2023[O] showed LVEF of 35%, improved from 25% on [B-DATE]9/10/2023[O].
- Daily weight recorded a stable decrease from admission to discharge weight, indicative of successful fluid management.

Consultations:
- Nephrology consulted on [B-DATE]9/11/2023[O], provided recommendations on renal-safe diuretic use and follow-up post-discharge.
