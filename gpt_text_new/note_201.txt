[**Reason for Hospitalization**]
Mr. [**B-NAME**]Thompson[**O**] was admitted with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and secondary hypertension.

[**Hospital Course**]
Mr. [**B-NAME**]Thompson[**O**] was initially brought to the emergency department complaining of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm.

Cardiology managed his post-MI medications, optimizing his regimen of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins.
