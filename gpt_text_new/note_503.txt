Discharge Diagnosis: COPD, pneumonia  

**Hospital Course:**  
Mrs. [B-NAME]Thompson[O] presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of increased shortness of breath, wheezing, and a productive cough that had worsened over the past week. Upon admission, her oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, and she was started on 2 liters nasal cannula which was later increased to 4 liters due to persisting hypoxia. Chest X-rays indicated new infiltrates on the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia. She was started on antibiotics and steroids, and her symptoms gradually improved with treatment. 

The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout her hospital stay. Spirometry indicated a decrease in lung function compared to previous results one year ago. Due to her repeated admissions for COPD exacerbations, a referral to a pulmonary specialist at [B-ORGANIZATION]Metropolitan Pulmonary Clinic[O] was made for further evaluation and management.

**Discharge Medications:**  
1. Azithromycin 500 mg, Oral, daily for 3 days  
2. Prednisone 40 mg, Oral, daily, taper over 14 days  
3. Albuterol Inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed for wheezing
