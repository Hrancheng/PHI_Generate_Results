**Discharge Diagnosis:** Same as admitting diagnosis  
**Attending Physician:** Dr. [B-NAME]Helen Mirren[O]

**Hospital Course:**
[B-NAME]Gloria Thompson[O] was admitted with symptoms of dyspnea and orthopnea. Her condition was stabilized using IV diuretics and BiPAP support initially in the Cardiac Care Unit and later stepped down to the medical floor as her condition improved.

**Consultations:**
1. Cardiology: Adjusted heart failure medications and reinforced the importance of strict fluid and sodium restriction.
2. Nutrition: Consulted to help optimize a low sodium diet.
3. Social Work: Assessed need for home health aids considering the patient's reduced mobility and the spouse's inability to fully support ADLs.

**Medications on Discharge:**
- Furosemide 40 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet by mouth twice daily.
- Carvedilol 25 mg tablet: Take 1 tablet by mouth twice daily.

**Analysis:**
