**Hospital Course:**
[B-NAME]Margaret Thompson[O] was admitted under the care of Dr. [B-NAME]Amelia Watson[O], following a presentation of acute chest pain and shortness of breath.

Cardiac catheterization performed on [B-DATE]02/11/2023[O] revealed two blocked coronary arteries, which were subsequently addressed with the placement of drug-eluting stents.

The patient initially experienced cardiogenic shock, which was managed aggressively with intravenous inotropes. Her condition stabilized over the following days with significant improvement in her cardiac function, evidenced by an ejection fraction improvement from 30% to 45% on the follow-up echocardiogram performed on [B-DATE]02/20/2023[O].

Her hospital course was complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia, diagnosed on [B-DATE]02/15/2023[O], for which she received intravenous antibiotics, with subsequent resolution evident on the repeat chest X-ray on [B-DATE]02/23/2023[O].

**Discharge Medications:**
1. Aspirin 81 mg daily
2. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily
3. Atorvastatin 40 mg at bedtime
4. Metoprolol 50 mg twice daily
5. Lisinopril 10 mg daily

**Follow-up Appointments:**
- Cardiology follow-up with Dr. [B-NAME]Elena Gilbert[O] at [B-ORGANIZATION]Carmel Heart and Vascular Clinic[O] on [B-DATE]03/01/2023[O].
- Primary care follow-up with Dr. [B-NAME]Jonathan Myers[O], scheduled for [B-DATE]03/05/2023[O].

**Future Planning:**
The patient and family were educated about the signs and symptoms of potential complications including wound infection and chest pain. They were provided with contact numbers for the cardiology clinic and advised to return to the ER or call 911 if symptoms of a myocardial infarction recur.

**Preventive Measures:**
A referral was made to the cardiac rehabilitation program at [B-ORGANIZATION]Carmel Health System[O], expected to begin within two weeks of discharge. This program will assist the patient in safely developing a healthier lifestyle to prevent future cardiac events.

**Readmission Risk:**
LACE index calculated at discharge indicates a moderate risk for readmission due to the complexity of the cardiac condition and the recent surgical intervention. Regular follow-up and adherence to medication and lifestyle changes are critical in managing her condition effectively. 

**Communication with PCP:**
A discharge summary was electronically sent to Dr. [B-NAME]Jonathan Myers[O] to ensure continuity of care. The patient's primary care physician is encouraged to monitor renal function and electrolytes due to ongoing Lisinopril therapy, which will be essential in managing her blood pressure in the long-term setting.
