Upon admission, her symptoms included shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema. Diagnostic tests on [B-DATE]August 14, 2023[O] confirmed heart failure exacerbation and revealed pneumonia triggering the symptoms.   Treatment initiated with intravenous diuretics and antibiotics led to improvement in her cardiac function and resolution of pneumonia. She was closely monitored with daily chest X-rays and ECGs that showed gradual improvement. Medication adjustments included increasing the dose of Lasix to better manage her fluid status, which showed good tolerance and effectiveness.  Her echocardiogram on [B-DATE]August 16, 2023[O] showed a stable ejection fraction of 35% with mild improvement from admission. Daily physical therapy was conducted to maintain muscle strength without straining her heart, showing positive results in mobility and self-care by discharge.  Mr. [B-NAME]Peter Frey[O], her husband, was instructed on recognizing signs of worsening heart failure, proper medication administration, and the importance of the low-sodium diet. Both were responsive and appreciative of the education provided.  **Final Review and Recommendations:**   - Outpatient follow-up with her cardiologist, [B-NAME]Ivan Gregg[O], scheduled for [B-DATE]August 27, 2023[O], at [B-ORGANIZATION]Heart Health Specialists[O]. - A follow-up call will be placed next week to assess home adjustment and any immediate needs or concerns. - Encouraged participation in [B-ORGANIZATION]Healthwise Heart Rehabilitation Sessions[O] to ensure ongoing physical conditioning in a monitored environment.  This plan has been reviewed with the patient and her family, and they expressed understanding and agreement with the steps going forward. Discharge medications have been double-checked for accuracy, dosages, and potential interactions with her existing prescriptions.  **Signed:** Dr. [B-NAME]Hannah Miles[O], MD   [B-DATE]August 20, 2023[O], 2:00 PM
