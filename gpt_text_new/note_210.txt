[B-NAME]Elizabeth[O] presented to the emergency department at [B-ORGANIZATION]General Hospital[O] on [B-DATE]March 21, 2023[O], complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon arrival, she was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic. An EKG confirmed ST-elevation MI, and she was urgently taken to the catheterization lab where a successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed on the right coronary artery. 

Post-PCI, the patient was admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring and further evaluation.
