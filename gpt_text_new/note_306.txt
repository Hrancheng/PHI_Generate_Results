### Hospital Course: Brief Overview
**[B-NAME]Elizabeth Thompson[O]** was initially admitted following an episode of severe chest pain at home. Upon arrival via EMS, ECG confirmed ST-elevation MI, and she was taken directly to the [B-LOCATION]cath lab[O] for emergent coronary angiography, which revealed triple vessel disease. Immediate PCI was performed with stent placement in the LAD. Post-procedure, she was managed in the [B-LOCATION]ICU[O] for close monitoring due to initial low ejection fraction and episodes of non-sustained VT.

She responded well to diuretics and beta-blockade, achieving stabilization of her heart failure symptoms. Ejection fraction improved from 30% to 40%. Atrial fibrillation was managed with IV amiodarone and later transitioned to oral. The patient was downgraded to the [B-LOCATION]Telemetry Floor[O] on [B-DATE]9/14/2023[O] and remained there until discharge.
