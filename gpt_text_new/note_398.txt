**Hospital Course:**
[B-NAME]Michael Thompson[O] was admitted following an episode of acute chest pain at home. His past medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia. On admission, ECG showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads and troponin levels were elevated. He underwent immediate coronary angiography that revealed a 90% occlusion in the left anterior descending artery, successfully treated with angioplasty and stent placement. His hospital course was complicated by a transient decline in renal function, attributed to contrast-induced nephropathy. This improved with IV hydration and careful management of his medications. His remaining hospital course was uneventful, and his cardiac function showed improvement on repeat testing.
