**Hospital Course:**  
Ms. [B-NAME]Manning[O] presented to the emergency department with increased shortness of breath and a productive cough on [B-DATE]10/23/2023[O]. Her symptoms were consistent with an acute exacerbation of her known COPD. She reported a recent history of non-adherence to her inhaler regimen.

She was treated with intravenous corticosteroids and antibiotics during her stay. Her hospital course was complicated by a transient episode of atrial fibrillation, which resolved with rate control. Pulmonary function tests indicated a moderate obstruction, with FEV1 at 65% expected. She responded well to treatment and was stepped down to oral medications.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Salbutamol Inhaler: 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed  
- Prednisone: 40 mg orally daily for 5 days
