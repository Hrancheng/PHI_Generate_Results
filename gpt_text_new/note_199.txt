**MRN:** [B-ID]472159875[O]  
**Age:** [B-AGE]78 y.o.[O]

**Attending Provider:** Dr. [B-NAME]William Harris[O]  
**Reason for Admission:** 
vascular insufficiency with complications secondary to diabetes and acute kidney injury.
  
**Hospital Course:**  
[B-NAME]Ms. Clarke[O] was admitted to [B-ORGANIZATION]Mount Sinai Medical Center[O] with signs of vascular insufficiency affecting both lower limbs, compounded by her long-standing diabetes. Upon admission, her laboratory results reflected acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine levels not previously recorded. During her stay, Ms. Clarke received IV hydration, insulin therapy, and monitoring of her renal function, which showed gradual improvement. Vascular surgery was consulted, and after evaluation, conservative management with medication adjustments was recommended due to the patient's frail condition and potential surgical risks.

During her continuance in the medical unit, [B-NAME]Ms. Clarke[O] demonstrated slow but progressive recovery in kidney function, and her extremity perfusion remained stable with the new medication regimen. Dietary consultations helped tailor a diabetic-friendly diet that supports renal health.

**Procedures Performed:**  
1. Continuous insulin infusion
2. Daily lower extremity Doppler studies
3. Nutritional therapy assessment by [B-NAME]Dietitian Anna Shultz[O]

**Consultations:**  
Nephrology, Cardiology, Vascular surgery, Diabetes Management Team.

**Condition at Discharge:**  
Stable with plans to follow up in the outpatient setting for further management of diabetes and vascular care. AKI resolved as indicated by normalization of creatinine.

**Discharge Medications:**  
1. Insulin Glargine 40 units at bedtime  
2. Metformin 500 mg twice a day  
3. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily  
4. Atorvastatin 20 mg at night

**Instructions:**

She is instructed to monitor her blood sugar levels four times a day and adjust the sliding scale insulin as taught. She should also observe her feet daily for any signs of decreased circulation or injury. Should she notice any changes in her condition, such as increased pain or a return of renal symptoms, she is to contact her primary care provider immediately or return to the Emergency Department.
